# Pipeline Dependency Requirements
# Target: CASA >= 6.6.6 with Python 3.10 / 3.12
#
# This file lists direct dependencies (excplicit imports) for the Pipeline Runtime.
# For detailed setup and installation instructions, see the project's README.md.

# -- Core Runtime Dependencies --

numpy>=2.0,<2.4                           # PIPE-2930: keep <2.4 until the compatibility is verified
astropy~=7.2; python_version >= '3.11'    # Main astronomy library; version for Python 3.11+
astropy~=6.1; python_version == '3.10'    # Last major version compatible with Python 3.10
cachetools~=6.2                           # Extensible memoizing collections and decorators
docstring-inheritance~=2.2                # For inheriting docstrings
intervaltree~=3.1                         # Data structure for intervals
logutils~=0.3                             # Handlers for the standard logging package

# -- Optional & Tooling Dependencies --
# Required for specific pipelines (e.g., VLASS) or for profiling and monitoring.

bdsf~=1.13                                # Source finder for VLASS pipeline (PyBDSF)
ps_mem~=3.14                              # For accurately reporting memory usage
