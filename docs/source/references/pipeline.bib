	year = 2019,
	abstract = {LSST has chosen Kubernetes as the platform for deploying and operating the LSST Science Platform. We first present the background reasoning behind this decision, including both instrument-agnostic as well as LSST-specific requirements. We then discuss the basic principles of Kubernetes and Helm, and how they are used as the deployment base for the LSST Science Platform. Furthermore, we provide an example of how an external group may use these publicly available software resources to deploy their own instance of the LSST Science Platform, and customize it to their needs. Finally, we discuss how more astronomy software can follow these patterns to gain similar benefits.},

	abstract = {Radio synthesis imaging is dependent upon deconvolution algorithms to counteract the sparse sampling of the Fourier plane. These deconvolution algorithms find an estimate of the true sky brightness from the necessarily incomplete sampled visibility data. The most widely used radio synthesis deconvolution method is the CLEAN algorithm of Hogbom. This algorithm works extremely well for collections of point sources and surprisingly well for extended objects. However, the performance for extended objects can be improved by adopting a multiscale approach. We describe and demonstrate a conceptually simple and algorithmically straightforward extension to CLEAN that models the sky brightness by the summation of components of emission having different size scales. While previous multiscale algorithms work sequentially on decreasing scale sizes, our algorithm works simultaneously on a range of specified scales. Applications to both real and simulated data sets are given.},

The implementation of multi-scale CLEAN in the CASA software package is used, although comparisons are made against the very similar multi-resolution CLEAN algorithm implemented in AIPS. Both are compared against the classical CLEAN algorithm (as implemented in AIPS). The results of this comparison show that several of the well-known characteristics and issues of using classical CLEAN are significantly lessened (or eliminated completely) when using the multi-scale CLEAN algorithm. Importantly, multi-scale CLEAN significantly reduces the effects of the clean "bowl" that is caused by missing short-spacings, and the "pedestal" of low-level un-cleaned flux (which affects flux scales and resolution). Multi-scale CLEAN can clean down to the noise level without the divergence suffered by classical CLEAN. We discuss practical applications of the added contrast provided by multi-scale CLEAN using two selected astronomical examples: H I holes in the interstellar medium and anomalous gas structures outside the main galactic disk.},

We present a new wide-field interferometric imager that uses the w-stacking algorithm and can make use of the w-snapshot algorithm. The performance dependences of CASA's w-projection and our new imager are analysed and analytical functions are derived that describe the required computing cost for both imagers. On data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we find our new method to be an order of magnitude faster than w-projection, as well as being capable of full-sky imaging at full resolution and with correct polarization correction. We predict the computing costs for several other arrays and estimate that our imager is a factor of 2-12 faster, depending on the array configuration. We estimate the computing cost for imaging the low-frequency Square Kilometre Array observations to be 60 PetaFLOPS with current techniques. We find that combining w-stacking with the w-snapshot algorithm does not significantly improve computing requirements over pure w-stacking. The source code of our new imager is publicly released.},

	abstract = {Realizing the next generation of radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) requires both more efficient hardware and algorithms than today's technology provides. The image-domain gridding (IDG) algorithm is a novel approach towards solving the most compute-intensive parts of creating sky images: gridding and degridding. It alleviates the performance bottlenecks of traditional AW-projection gridding by applying instrumental and environmental corrections in the image domain instead of in the Fourier domain. In this paper, we present a thorough performance analysis of this algorithm for an Intel Xeon CPU, Intel Xeon Phi, and GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA. We show that, by evaluating trigonometric functions in hardware, GPUs are both much faster and more energy efficient than a CPU or Xeon Phi. Furthermore, on GPUs, IDG is an order of magnitude faster and more energy efficient than traditional AW-projection. IDG on GPUs is the ideal candidate imaging technique for the SKA, as it meets the computational and energy constraints of the SKA Science Data Processor system.},

	title = {{A novel approach to visibility-space modelling of interferometric gravitational lens observations at high angular resolution}},
	year = 2020,
	abstract = {We present a new gravitational lens modelling technique designed to model high-resolution interferometric observations with large numbers of visibilities without the need to pre-average the data in time or frequency. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method using validation tests on mock observations. Using small data sets with ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> visibilities, we first compare our approach with the more traditional direct Fourier transform (DFT) implementation and direct linear solver. Our tests indicate that our source inversion is indistinguishable from that of the DFT. Our method also infers lens parameters to within 1 to 2 per cent of both the ground truth and DFT, given sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). When the SNR is as low as 5, both approaches lead to errors of several tens of per cent in the lens parameters and a severely disrupted source structure, indicating that this is related to the SNR and choice of priors rather than the modelling technique itself. We then analyze a large data set with ∼10<SUP>8</SUP> visibilities and a SNR matching real global Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations of the gravitational lens system MG J0751+2716. The size of the data is such that it cannot be modelled with traditional implementations. Using our novel technique, we find that we can infer the lens parameters and the source brightness distribution, respectively, with an RMS error of 0.25 and 0.97 per cent relative to the ground truth.},

	volume = {499},
	year = 2020,
	abstract = {The desire for wide field of view, large fractional bandwidth, high sensitivity, high spectral and temporal resolution has driven radio interferometry to the point of big data revolution where the data are represented in at least three dimensions with an axis for spectral windows, baselines, sources, etc., where each axis has its own set of subdimensions. The cost associated with storing and handling these data is very large, and therefore several techniques to compress interferometric data and/or speed up processing have been investigated. Unfortunately, averaging-based methods for visibility data compression are detrimental to the data fidelity, since the point spread function (PSF) is position-dependent, that is, distorted and attenuated as a function of distance from the phase centre. The position dependence of the PSF becomes more severe, requiring more PSF computations for wide-field imaging. Deconvolution algorithms must take the distortion into account in the major and minor cycles to properly subtract the PSF and recover the fidelity of the image. This approach is expensive in computation since at each deconvolution iteration a distorted PSF must be computed. We present two algorithms that approximate these position-dependent PSFs with fewer computations. The first algorithm approximates the position-dependent PSFs in the uv-plane and the second algorithm approximates the position-dependent PSFs in the image plane. The proposed algorithms are validated using simulated data from the MeerKAT telescope.},

	title = {{Image Domain Gridding: a fast method for convolutional resampling of visibilities}},
	volume = {616},
	year = 2018,
	abstract = {In radio astronomy obtaining a high dynamic range in synthesis imaging of wide fields requires a correction for time and direction-dependent effects. Applying direction-dependent correction can be done by either partitioning the image in facets and applying a direction-independent correction per facet, or by including the correction in the gridding kernel (AW-projection). An advantage of AW-projection over faceting is that the effectively applied beam is a sinc interpolation of the sampled beam, where the correction applied in the faceting approach is a discontinuous piece wise constant beam. However, AW-projection quickly becomes prohibitively expensive when the corrections vary over short time scales. This occurs, for example, when ionospheric effects are included in the correction. The cost of the frequent recomputation of the oversampled convolution kernels then dominates the total cost of gridding. Image domain gridding is a new approach that avoids the costly step of computing oversampled convolution kernels. Instead low-resolution images are made directly for small groups of visibilities which are then transformed and added to the large uv grid. The computations have a simple, highly parallel structure that maps very well onto massively parallel hardware such as graphical processing units (GPUs). Despite being more expensive in pure computation count, the throughput is comparable to classical W-projection. The accuracy is close to classical gridding with a continuous convolution kernel. Compared to gridding methods that use a sampled convolution function, the new method is more accurate. Hence, the new method is at least as fast and accurate as classical W-projection, while allowing for the correction for quickly varying direction-dependent effects.},
