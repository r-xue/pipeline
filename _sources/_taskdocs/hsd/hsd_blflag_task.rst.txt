hsd_blflag
==========

Task description
-----------------
Data are flagged based on several flagging rules. Available rules are:
expected rms, calculated rms, and running mean of both pre-fit and
post-fit spectra. Tsys flagging is also available.

In addition, the heuristics script creates many plots for each stage.
Those plots are included in the weblog.

Output:

results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

Parameter List 
--------------
.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - iteration
      - | Number of iterations to perform sigma clipping to calculate threshold value of flagging.
    * - edge
      - | Number of channels to be dropped from the edge. The value must be a list of integer with length of one or
        | two. If list length is one, same number will be applied
        | both side of the band.
        | example: [10,20], [10]
    * - flag_tsys
      - | Activate (True) or deactivate (False) Tsys flag.
    * - tsys_thresh
      - | Threshold value for Tsys flag.
    * - flag_prfre
      - | Activate (True) or deactivate (False) flag by expected rms of pre-fit spectra.
    * - prfre_thresh
      - | Threshold value for flag by expected rms of pre-fit spectra.
    * - flag_pofre
      - | Activate (True) or deactivate (False) flag by expected rms of post-fit spectra.
    * - pofre_thresh
      - | Threshold value for flag by expected rms of post-fit spectra.
    * - flag_prfr
      - | Activate (True) or deactivate (False) flag by rms of pre-fit spectra.
    * - prfr_thresh
      - | Threshold value for flag by rms of pre-fit spectra.
    * - flag_pofr
      - | Activate (True) or deactivate (False) flag by rms of post-fit spectra.
    * - pofr_thresh
      - | Threshold value for flag by rms of post-fit spectra.
    * - flag_prfrm
      - | Activate (True) or deactivate (False) flag by running mean of pre-fit spectra.
    * - prfrm_thresh
      - | Threshold value for flag by running mean of pre-fit spectra.
    * - prfrm_nmean
      - | Number of channels for running mean of pre-fit spectra.
    * - flag_pofrm
      - | Activate (True) or deactivate (False) flag by running mean of post-fit spectra.
    * - pofrm_thresh
      - | Threshold value for flag by running mean of post-fit spectra.
    * - pofrm_nmean
      - | Number of channels for running mean of post-fit spectra.
    * - plotflag
      - | True to plot result of data flagging.
    * - parallel
      - | Execute using CASA HPC functionality, if available. options: 'automatic', 'true', 'false', True, False
        | default: None (equivalent to 'automatic')
    * - infiles
      - | ASDM or MS files to be processed. This parameter behaves as data selection parameter. The name specified by
        | infiles must be registered to context before you run
        | hsd_blflag.
    * - antenna
      - | Data selection by antenna names or ids. example: 'PM03,PM04'
        | '' (all antennas)
    * - field
      - | Data selection by field names or ids. example: '`*Sgr*,M100`'
        | '' (all fields)
    * - spw
      - | Data selection by spw ids. example: '3,4' (spw 3 and 4)
        | '' (all spws)
    * - pol
      - | Data selection by polarizations. example: 'XX,YY' (correlation XX and YY)
        | '' (all polarizations)
