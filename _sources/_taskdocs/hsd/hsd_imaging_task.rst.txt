hsd_imaging
===========

Task description
-----------------
The hsd_imaging task generates single dish images per antenna as
well as combined image over whole antennas for each field and
spectral window. Image configuration (grid size, number of pixels,
etc.) is automatically determined based on meta data such as
antenna diameter, map extent, etc.

Note that generated images are always in LSRK frame.

Output:
results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - mode
      - | Imaging mode controls imaging parameters in the task. Accepts either "line" (spectral line imaging) or "ampcal"
        | (image settings for amplitude calibrator)
    * - restfreq
      - | Rest frequency
    * - infiles
      - | List of data files. These must be a name of MeasurementSets that are registered to context via
        | hsd_importdata task.
        | example: vis=['uid___A002_X85c183_X36f.ms',
        | 'uid___A002_X85c183_X60b.ms']
    * - field
      - | Data selection by field names or ids. example: "`*Sgr*,M100`"
    * - spw
      - | Data selection by spw ids. example: "3,4" (generate images for spw 3 and 4)


Examples 
--------
1. Generate images with default settings and context

>>> hsd_imaging()

2. Generate images with amplitude calibrator and specific parameters

>>> hsd_imaging(mode='ampcal', field='*Sgr*,M100', spw='17,19')
