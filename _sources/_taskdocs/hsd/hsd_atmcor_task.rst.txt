hsd_atmcor
==========

Task description
-----------------
The hsd_atmcor task provides the capability of offline correction of
residual atmospheric features in the calibrated single-dish spectra
originated from incomplete calibration mainly due to a difference of
elevation angles between ON_SOURCE and OFF_SOURCE measurements.

Optimal atmospheric model is automatically determined by default
(atmtype = 'auto'). You may specify desired atmospheric model by giving
either single integer (apply to all EBs) or a list of integers (models
per EB) to atmtype parameter. Please see parameter description for the
meanings of integer values.

Parameter List

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - atmtype
      - | Type of atmospheric transmission model represented as an integer. Available options are as follows. Integer values can be given as
        | either integer or string, i.e. both 1 and '1' are acceptable.
        | 'auto': perform heuristics to choose best model (default)
        | 1: tropical
        | 2: mid latitude summer
        | 3: mid latitude winter
        | 4: subarctic summer
        | 5: subarctic winter
        | If list of integer is given, it also performs heuristics using the
        | provided values instead of default, [1, 2, 3, 4], which is used
        | when 'auto' is provided. List input should not contain 'auto'.
        | Default: 'auto'
    * - dtem_dh
      - | Temperature gradient [K/km], e.g. -5.6. ("" = Tool default) The value is directly passed to initialization method for ATM model.
        | Float and string types are acceptable. Float value is interpreted as
        | the value in K/km. String value should be the numeric value with unit
        | such as '-5.6K/km'. When list of values are given, it will
        | trigger heuristics to choose best model from the provided value.
        | Default: '' (tool default, -5.6K/km, is used)
    * - h0
      - | Scale height for water [km], e.g. 2.0. ("" = Tool default) The value is directly passed to initialization method for ATM model.
        | Float and string types are acceptable. Float value is interpreted as
        | the value in kilometer. String value should be the numeric value with
        | unit compatible with length, such as '2km' or '2000m'.
        | When list of values are given, it will trigger heuristics to
        | choose best model from the provided value.
        | Default: '' (tool default, 2.0km, is used)
    * - infiles
      - | ASDM or MS files to be processed. This parameter behaves as data selection parameter. The name specified by
        | infiles must be registered to context before you run
        | hsd_atmcor.
    * - antenna
      - | Data selection by antenna names or ids. example: 'PM03,PM04'
        | '' (all antennas)
    * - field
      - | Data selection by field names or ids. example: '`*Sgr*,M100`'
        | '' (all fields)
    * - spw
      - | Data selection by spw ids. example: '3,4' (spw 3 and 4)
        | '' (all spws)
    * - pol
      - | Data selection by polarizations. example: 'XX,YY' (correlation XX and YY)
        | '' (all polarizations)


Examples 
--------
1. Basic usage

>>> hsd_atmcor()

2. Specify atmospheric model and data selection

>>> hsd_atmcor(atmtype=1, antenna='PM03,PM04', field='*Sgr*,M100')

3. Specify atmospheric model per EB (atmtype 1 for 1st EB, 2 for 2nd EB)

>>> hsd_atmcor(atmtype=[1, 2])
