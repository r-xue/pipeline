hifv_mstransform
================

Task description
-----------------
Create new MeasurementSets for imaging from the corrected column of the input
MeasurementSet via calling mstransform with all data selection parameters.
By default, all science target data is copied to the new MS(s). The
new MeasurementSet is not re-indexed to the selected data and the new MS will
have the same source, field, and spw names and ids as it does in the parent MS.

The first MeasurementSet that is produced is intended for continuum imaging and
will end in targets_cont.ms. If there are spws that have been detected or specified as
spectral line spws in the input MeasurementSet, an MS for science target line imaging
will also be produced, which will end in _targets.ms.

Output

results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

Parameter List 
--------------
.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
        | '': use all MeasurementSets in the context
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - outputvis
      - | The list of output transformed MeasurementSets to be used for continuum imaging. The output list must be the same length as the input
        | list. The default output name defaults to
        | <msrootname>_targets_cont.ms
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms',
        | ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - outputvis_for_line
      - | The list of output transformed MeasurementSets to be used for line imaging. The output list must be the same length as the input
        | list. The default output name defaults to
        | <msrootname>_targets.ms
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms',
        | ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - field
      - | Select fields name(s) or id(s) to transform. Only fields with data matching the intent will be selected.
        | Examples: '3C279', 'Centaurus*', '3C279,J1427-421'
    * - intent
      - | Select intents for which associated fields will be imaged. By default only TARGET data is selected.
        | Examples: 'PHASE,BANDPASS'
    * - spw
      - | Select spectral window/channels to include for continuum imaging. By default all science spws for which the specified intent is valid are
        | selected.
    * - spw_line
      - | Select spectral window/channels to include for line imaging. If specified, these will override the default, which
        | is to use the spws identified as specline_windows in hifv_importdata
        | or hifv_restoredata.
    * - chanbin
      - | Width (bin) of input channels to average to form an output channel. If chanbin > 1 then chanaverage is automatically
        | switched to True.
    * - timebin
      - | Bin width for time averaging. If timebin > 0s then timeaverage is automatically switched to True.
    * - omit_contline_ms
      - | If True, don't make the contline ms (_targets.ms). Only make cont MS (_targets_cont.ms). Default is False.
        | 


Examples 
--------
1. Create a science target MS from the corrected column in the input MS.

>>> hifv_mstransform()

2. Make a phase and bandpass calibrator targets MS from the corrected
column in the input MS.

>>> hifv_mstransform(intent='PHASE,BANDPASS')
