    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hifv_importdata task.
    * - checkflagmode
      - | -- Standard VLA modes with improved RFI flagging heuristics: 'bpd-vla', 'allcals-vla', 'target-vla' -- blank string default use of rflag on bandpass and delay calibrators
        | -- use string 'semi' after hifv_semiFinalBPdcals() for executing rflag on calibrators
        | -- use string 'bpd', for the bandpass and delay calibrators:
        | execute rflag on all calibrated cross-hand corrected data;
        | extend flags to all correlations
        | execute rflag on all calibrated parallel-hand residual data;
        | extend flags to all correlations
        | execute tfcrop on all calibrated cross-hand corrected data,
        | per visibility; extend flags to all correlations
        | execute tfcrop on all calibrated parallel-hand corrected data,
        | per visibility; extend flags to all correlations
        | -- use string 'allcals', for all the other calibrators, with delays and BPcal applied:
        | similar procedure as 'bpd' mode, but uses corrected data throughout
        | -- use string 'target', for the target data:
        | similar procedure as 'allcals' mode, but with a higher SNR cutoff
        | for rflag to avoid flagging data due to source structure, and
        | with an additional series of tfcrop executions to make up for
        | the higher SNR cutoff in rflag
        | -- VLASS specific modes include 'bpd-vlass', 'allcals-vlass', and 'target-vlass'
        | which calculate thresholds to use per spw/field/scan (action='calculate', then,
        | per baseband/field/scan, replace all spw thresholds above the median with the median,
        | before re-running rflag with the new thresholds.  This has the effect of
        | lowering the thresholds for spws with RFI to be closer to the RFI-free
        | thresholds, and catches more of the RFI.
        | -- Mode 'vlass-imaging' is similar to 'target-vlass', except that it executes on the split off target
        | data, intent='*TARGET', datacolumn='data' and uses a timedevscale of 4.0.
    * - growflags
      - | Grow flags in time at the end of the following checkflagmodes: default=True, for 'bpd-vla', 'allcals-vla', 'bpd', and 'allcals'
        | default=False, for '' and 'semi'
    * - overwrite_modelcol
      - | Always write the model column, even if it already exists


Examples 
--------
1. Run RFLAG with associated heuristics in the VLA CASA pipeline.
