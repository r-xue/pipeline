hifa_fluxcalflag
================

Task description
-----------------
Search the built-in solar system flux calibrator line catalog for overlaps with
the science spectral windows. Generate a list of line overlap regions and
flagging commands.

Output:

    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

Parameter List 
--------------
.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
        | MeasurementSets defined in the pipeline context.
    * - field
      - | The list of field names or field ids for which the models are
        | to be set. Defaults to all fields with intent 'AMPLITUDE'.
        | Example: field='3C279', field='3C279, M82'
    * - intent
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against
        | which the selected fields are matched. Defaults to all data
        | with amplitude intent.
        | Example: intent='AMPLITUDE'
    * - spw
      - | Spectral windows and channels for which bandpasses are
        | computed. Defaults to all science spectral windows.
        | Example: spw='11,13,15,17'
    * - threshold
      - | If the fraction of a spectral window occupied by line regions
        | is greater than this threshold value, then flag the entire
        | spectral window.
    * - appendlines
      - | Append user defined line regions to the line dictionary.
    * - linesfile
      - | Read in a file containing lines regions and append it to the
        | builtin dictionary. Blank lines and comments beginning with #
        | are skipped. The data is contained in 4 whitespace delimited
        | fields containing the solar system object field name, e.g.
        | 'Callisto', the molecular species name, e.g. '13CO', and the
        | starting and ending frequency in GHz.
    * - applyflags
      - | Boolean for whether to apply the generated flag commands. (default True)
