hifa_flagdata
=============

Task description
-----------------
The hifa_flagdata data performs basic flagging operations on a list of
measurements including:

- applying online flags
- applying a flagging template
- partial polarization flagging
- autocorrelation data flagging
- shadowed antenna data flagging
- scan-based flagging by intent or scan number
- edge channel flagging, as needed
- low atmospheric transmission flagging

About the spectral window edge channel flagging:

- For TDM spectral windows, a number of edge channels are always flagged,
  according to the ``fracspw`` and ``fracspwfps`` parameters (the latter
  operates only on spectral windows with 62, 124, or 248 channels). With the
  default setting of ``fracspw``, the number of channels flagged on each edge
  is 2, 4, or 8 for 64, 128, or 256-channel spectral windows, respectively.

- For most FDM spectral windows, no edge flagging is done. The only exceptions
  are ACA spectral windows that encroach too close to the baseband edge.
  Channels that lie closer to the baseband edge than the following values are
  flagged: 62.5, 40, 20, 10, and 5 MHz for spectral windows with bandwidths of
  1000, 500, 250, 125, and 62.5 MHz, respectively. A warning is generated in
  the weblog if flagging occurs due to proximity to the baseband edge.
  By definition, 2000 MHz spectral windows always encroach the baseband edge on
  both sides of the spectral window, and thus are always flagged on both sides
  in order to achieve 1875 MHz bandwidth (in effect, they are flagged by
  62.5 MHz on each side), and thus no warning is generated.

Output:

    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

Parameter List

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
        | MeasurementSets defined in the pipeline context.
    * - autocorr
      - | Flag autocorrelation data.
    * - shadow
      - | Flag shadowed antennas.
    * - tolerance
      - | Amount of antenna shadowing tolerated, in meters. A positive number
        | allows antennas to overlap in projection. A negative number forces antennas
        | apart in projection. Zero implies a distance of radius_1+radius_2 between
        | antenna centers.
    * - scan
      - | Flag a list of specified scans.
    * - scannumber
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of scans to be
        | flagged.
        | Example: scannumber='3,5,6'
    * - intents
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against
        | which the scans to be flagged are matched.
        | Example: intents='`*BANDPASS*`'
    * - edgespw
      - | Flag the edge spectral window channels.
    * - fracspw
      - | Fraction of channels to flag at both edges of TDM spectral windows.
    * - fracspwfps
      - | Fraction of channels to flag at both edges of ACA TDM
        | spectral windows that were created with the earlier (original)
        | implementation of the frequency profile synthesis (FPS) algorithm.
    * - online
      - | Apply the online flags.
    * - partialpol
      - | Identify integrations in multi-polarisation data where part
        | of the polarization products are already flagged, and flag the other
        | polarization products in those integrations.
    * - lowtrans
      - | Flag spectral windows for which a significant fraction of
        | the channels have atmospheric transmission below the
        | threshold (``mintransrepspw``, ``mintransnonrepspws``).
    * - mintransnonrepspws
      - | This atmospheric transmissivity threshold is used to flag
        | a non-representative science spectral window when more than 60% of
        | its channels have a transmissivity below this level.
    * - mintransrepspw
      - | This atmospheric transmissivity threshold is used to flag the
        | representative science spectral window when more than 60% of its channels
        | have a transmissivity below this level.
    * - fileonline
      - | File containing the online flags. These are computed by the
        | h_init or hif_importdata data tasks. If the online flags files
        | are undefined a name of the form 'msname.flagonline.txt' is assumed.
    * - template
      - | Apply flagging templates
    * - filetemplate
      - | The name of a text file that contains the flagging template
        | for RFI, birdies, telluric lines, etc. If the template flags files
        | is undefined a name of the form 'msname.flagtemplate.txt' is assumed.
    * - hm_tbuff
      - | The heuristic for computing the default time interval padding
        | parameter. The options are 'halfint' and 'manual'. In 'halfint' mode tbuff
        | is set to half the maximum of the median integration time of the science
        | and calibrator target observations. The value of 0.048 seconds is
        | subtracted from the lower time limit to accommodate the behavior of the
        | ALMA Control system.
    * - tbuff
      - | The time in seconds used to pad flagging command time
        | intervals if ``hm_tbuff`` = 'manual'. The default in
        | manual mode is no flagging.
    * - qa0
      - | QA0 flags.
    * - qa2
      - | QA2 flags.
    * - flagbackup
      - | Back up any pre-existing flags.


Examples 
--------
1. Do basic flagging on a MeasurementSet:

>>> hifa_flagdata()

2. Do basic flagging on a MeasurementSet flagging additional scans selected
by number as well:

>>> hifa_flagdata(scannumber='13,18')
