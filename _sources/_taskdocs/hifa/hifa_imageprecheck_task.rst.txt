hifa_imageprecheck
==================

Task description
-----------------
In this task, the representative source and the spw containing the representative
frequency selected by the PI in the OT are used to calculate the synthesized beam
and to make sensitivity estimates for the aggregate bandwidth and representative
bandwidth for several values of the Briggs robust parameter. This information is
reported in a table in the weblog. If no representative target/frequency information
is available, it defaults to the first target and center of first spw in the data
(e.g. pre-Cycle 5 data does not have this information available). The best Briggs
robust parameter to achieve the PI's desired angular resolution is chosen
automatically. See the User's guide for further details.

Output:

    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

Parameter List

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
        | '': use all MeasurementSets in the context
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - desired_angular_resolution
      - | User specified angular resolution goal string. When this parameter is set, uvtapering may be performed.
        | '': automatic from performance parameters (default)
        | Example: '1.0arcsec'
    * - calcsb
      - | Force (re-)calculation of sensitivities and beams; defaults to False
    * - parallel
      - | Use MPI cluster where possible


Examples 
--------
1. run with recommended settings to perform checks prior to imaging:

>>> hifa_imageprecheck()

2. run to perform checks prior to imaging and force the re-calculation of
sensitivities and beams:

>>> hifa_imageprecheck(calcsb=True)
