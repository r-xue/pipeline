hifa_diffgaincal
================

Task description
-----------------
This task creates the spectral window phase gain offset table used to allow
calibrating the "on-source" spectral setup with phase gains from a
"reference" spectral setup. A bright point source Quasar, called the
Differential Gain Calibrator (DIFFGAIN) source, is used for this purpose.
This DIFFGAIN source typically observed in groups of interleaved "reference"
and "on-source" scans, once at the start and once at the end of the
observations. In very long observations, there may be a group of scans
occurring during the middle. Scan groups are combined while solving for SpW
offsets between "reference" and "on-source" spectral setups.

Output:

    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.
