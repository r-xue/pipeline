hifa_wvrgcal
============

Task description
-----------------
Generate a gain table based on the Water Vapor Radiometer data in each vis
file. By applying the wvr calibration to the data specified by ``qa_intent``
and ``qa_spw``, calculate a QA score to indicate its effect on
interferometric data; a score > 1 implies that the phase noise is improved,
a score < 1 implies that it is made worse. If the score is less than
``accept_threshold`` then the wvr gain table is not accepted into the
context for subsequent use.

Output:

    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

Parameter List 
--------------
.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | List of input visibility files.
        | Default: none, in which case the vis files to be used
        | will be read from the context.
        | Example: vis=['ngc5921.ms']
    * - caltable
      - | List of output gain calibration tables.
        | Default: none, in which case the names of the caltables
        | will be generated automatically.
        | Example: caltable='ngc5921.wvr'
    * - offsetstable
      - | List of input temperature offsets table files to subtract
        | from WVR measurements before calculating phase corrections.
        | Default: none, in which case no offsets are applied.
        | Example: offsetstable=['ngc5921.cloud_offsets']
    * - hm_toffset
      - | If 'manual', set the ``toffset`` parameter to the user-specified value.
        | If 'automatic', set the ``toffset`` parameter according to the
        | date of the MeasurementSet; toffset=-1 if before 2013-01-21T00:00:00
        | toffset=0 otherwise.
    * - toffset
      - | Time offset (sec) between interferometric and WVR data.
    * - segsource
      - | If True calculate new atmospheric phase correction coefficients
        | for each source, subject to the constraints of the ``tie`` parameter.
        | 'segsource' is forced to be True if the ``tie`` parameter is set to a
        | non-empty value by the user or by the automatic heuristic.
    * - sourceflag
      - | Flag the WVR data for these source(s) as bad and do not
        | produce corrections for it. Requires ``segsource`` = True.
        | Example: ['3C273']
    * - hm_tie
      - | If 'manual', set the ``tie`` parameter to the
        | user-specified value. If 'automatic', set the ``tie``
        | parameter to include with the target all calibrators
        | that are within 15 degrees of it: if no calibrators are
        | that close then ``tie`` is left empty.
    * - tie
      - | Use the same atmospheric phase correction coefficients
        | when calculating the WVR correction for all sources in
        | the ``tie``. If ``tie`` is not empty then ``segsource``
        | is forced to be True. Ignored unless ``hm_tie`` = 'manual'.
        | Example: tie=['3C273,NGC253', 'IC433,3C279']
    * - nsol
      - | Number of solutions for phase correction coefficients during this
        | observation, evenly distributed in time throughout the observation. It
        | is used only if segsource=False because if segsource=True then the
        | coefficients are recomputed whenever the telescope moves to a new
        | source (within the limits imposed by 'tie').
    * - disperse
      - | Apply correction for dispersion. (Deprecated; will be removed)
    * - wvrflag
      - | Flag the WVR data for the listed antennas as bad and replace
        | their data with values interpolated from the 3 nearest antennas with
        | unflagged data.
        | Example: ['DV03','DA05','PM02']
    * - hm_smooth
      - | If 'manual' set the ``smooth`` parameter to the user-specified value.
        | If 'automatic', run the wvrgcal task with the range of ``smooth`` parameters
        | required to match the integration time of the wvr data to that of the
        | interferometric data in each spectral window.
    * - smooth
      - | Smooth WVR data on this timescale before calculating the correction.
        | Ignored unless hm_smooth='manual'.
    * - scale
      - | Scale the entire phase correction by this factor.
    * - maxdistm
      - | Maximum distance in meters of an antenna used for interpolation
        | from a flagged antenna.
        | Default: -1  (automatically set to 100m if >50% of
        | antennas are 7m antennas without WVR and otherwise set to
        | 500m).
        | Example: maxdistm=550
    * - minnumants
      - | Minimum number of nearby antennas (up to 3) used for
        | interpolation from a flagged antenna.
        | Example: minnumants=3
    * - mingoodfrac
      - | Minimum fraction of good data per antenna.
    * - refant
      - | Ranked comma delimited list of reference antennas.
        | Example: refant='DV01,DV02'
    * - qa_intent
      - | The list of data intents on which the wvr correction is to be
        | tried as a means of estimating its effectiveness.
        | A QA 'view' will be calculated for each specified intent, in each spectral
        | window in each vis file.
        | Each QA 'view' will consist of a pair of 2-d images with dimensions
        | ['ANTENNA', 'TIME'], one showing the data phase-noise before the
        | wvr application, the second showing the phase noise after (both 'before'
        | and 'after' images have a bandpass calibration applied as well).
        | An overall QA score is calculated for each vis file, by dividing the
        | 'before' images by the 'after' and taking the median of the result. An
        | overall score of 1 would correspond to no change in the phase noise,
        | a score > 1 implies an improvement.
        | If the overall score for a vis file is less than the value in
        | 'accept_threshold' then the wvr calibration file is not made available
        | for merging into the context for use in the subsequent reduction.
        | If you do not want any QA calculations then set qa_intent=''.
        | example: qa_intent='PHASE'
    * - qa_bandpass_intent
      - | The data intent to use for the bandpass calibration in
        | the qa calculation. The default is blank to allow the underlying bandpass
        | task to select a sensible intent if the dataset lacks BANDPASS data.
    * - qa_spw
      - | The SpW(s) to use for the qa calculation, in the order that they
        | should be tried. Input as a comma-separated list. The default is blank, in
        | which case the task will try SpWs in order of decreasing median sky
        | opacity.
    * - accept_threshold
      - | The phase-rms improvement ratio
        | (rms without wvr / rms with wvr) above which the wrvg file will be
        | accepted into the context for subsequent application.
