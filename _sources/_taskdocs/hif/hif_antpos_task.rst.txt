hif_antpos
==========

Task description
-----------------
Derive the antenna position calibration for list of MeasurementSets.

The hif_antpos task corrects the antenna positions recorded in the ASDMs using
updated antenna position calibration information determined after the
observation was taken.

Corrections can be input by hand, read from a file on disk, or in the future
by querying an ALMA database service.

The antenna positions file is in 'csv' format containing 6 comma-delimited
columns as shown below. The default name of this file is 'antennapos.csv'.

Contents of example 'antennapos.csv' file:

ms,antenna,xoffset,yoffset,zoffset,comment
uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e.ms,DV11,0.000,0.010,0.000,"No comment"
uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e.dup.ms,DV11,0.000,-0.010,0.000,"No comment"

The corrections are used to generate a calibration table which is recorded
in the pipeline context and applied to the raw visibility data, on the fly to
generate other calibration tables, or permanently to generate calibrated
visibilities for imaging.


Output

results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

Parameter List

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | List of input visibility files. example: ['ngc5921.ms']
    * - caltable
      - | Name of output gain calibration tables. example: ['ngc5921.gcal']
    * - hm_antpos
      - | Heuristics method for retrieving the antenna position corrections. The options are 'online' (not yet implemented), 'manual',
        | and 'file'.
    * - antenna
      - | The list of antennas for which the positions are to be corrected. Available when hm_antpos='manual'.
        | example: antenna='DV05,DV07'
    * - offsets
      - | The list of antenna offsets for each antenna in 'antennas'. Each offset is a set of 3 floating point numbers separated by commas, specified
        | in the ITRF frame. Available when hm_antpos='manual'.
        | example: offsets=[0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01]
    * - antposfile
      - | The file(s) containing the antenna offsets. Used if hm_antpos is 'file'.
        | example: 'antennapos.csv'


Examples 
--------
1. Correct the position of antenna 5 for all the visibility files in a single
pipeline run:

>>> hif_antpos(antenna='DV05', offsets=[0.01, 0.02, 0.03])

2. Correct the position of antennas for all the visibility files in a single
pipeline run using antenna positions files on disk. These files are assumed
to conform to a default naming scheme if ``antposfile`` is unspecified by the
user:

>>> hif_antpos(hm_antpos='file', antposfile='myantposfile.csv')
