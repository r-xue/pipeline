hif_setmodels
=============

Task description
-----------------
Set model fluxes values for calibrator reference and transfer sources using lookup
values. By default the reference sources are the flux calibrators and the transfer
sources are the bandpass, phase, and check source calibrators. Reference sources
which are also in the transfer source list are removed from the transfer source list.

Built-in lookup tables are used to compute models for solar system object calibrators.
Point source models are used for other calibrators with flux densities provided in the reference file.
Normalized fluxes are computed for transfer sources if the ``normfluxes`` parameter is
set to True.

The default reference file is 'flux.csv' in the current working directory.
This file is usually created in the importdata stage. The file is in
'csv' format and contains the following comma delimited columns.

vis,fieldid,spwid,I,Q,U,V,pix,comment


Output:

results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned

Parameter List 
--------------
.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the pipeline context.
        | example: ['M32A.ms', 'M32B.ms']
    * - reference
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of  field names defining the reference calibrators. Defaults to field names with
        | intent 'AMPLITUDE'.
        | example: 'M82,3C273'
    * - refintent
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of intents used to select the reference calibrators. Defaults to 'AMPLITUDE'.
        | example: 'BANDPASS'
    * - transfer
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of  field names defining the transfer calibrators. Defaults to field names with
        | intent ''.
        | example: 'J1328+041,J1206+30'
    * - transintent
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of intents defining the transfer calibrators. Defaults to 'BANDPASS,PHASE,CHECK'.
        | '' stands for no transfer sources.
        | example: 'PHASE'
    * - reffile
      - | The reference file containing a lookup table of point source models This file currently defaults to 'flux.csv' in the working directory. This
        | file must conform to the standard pipeline 'flux.csv' format
        | example: 'myfluxes.csv'
    * - normfluxes
      - | Normalize the transfer source flux densities.
    * - scalebychan
      - | Scale the flux density on a per channel basis or else on a per spw basis


Examples 
--------
1. Set model fluxes for the flux, bandpass, phase, and check sources.
