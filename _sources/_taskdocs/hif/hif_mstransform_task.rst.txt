hif_mstransform
===============

Task description
-----------------
Create new MeasurementSets for imaging from the corrected column of the input
MeasurementSet via a single call to mstransform with all data selection parameters.
By default, all science target data is copied to the new MS. The
new MeasurementSet is not re-indexed to the selected data and the new MS will
have the same source, field, and spw names and ids as it does in the parent MS.

Output

results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

Parameter List 
--------------
.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
        | '': use all MeasurementSets in the context
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - outputvis
      - | The list of output transformed MeasurementSets to be used for imaging. The output list must be the same length as the input
        | list. The default output name defaults to
        | <msrootname>_targets.ms
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms',
        | ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - field
      - | Select fields name(s) or id(s) to transform. Only fields with data matching the intent will be selected.
        | Examples: '3C279', 'Centaurus*', '3C279,J1427-421'
    * - intent
      - | Select intents for which associated fields will be imaged. By default only TARGET data is selected.
        | Examples: 'PHASE,BANDPASS'
    * - spw
      - | Select spectral window/channels to image. By default all science spws for which the specified intent is valid are
        | selected.
    * - chanbin
      - | Width (bin) of input channels to average to form an output channel. If chanbin > 1 then chanaverage is automatically
        | switched to True.
    * - timebin
      - | Bin width for time averaging. If timebin > 0s then timeaverage is automatically switched to True.


Examples 
--------
1. Create a science target MS from the corrected column in the input MS.

>>> hif_mstransform()

2. Make a phase and bandpass calibrator targets MS from the corrected
column in the input MS.

>>> hif_mstransform(intent='PHASE,BANDPASS')
