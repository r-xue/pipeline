hif_applycal
============

Task description
-----------------
Apply precomputed calibrations to the data.

hif_applycal applies the precomputed calibration tables stored in the pipeline
context to the set of visibility files using predetermined field and
spectral window maps and default values for the interpolation schemes.

Users can interact with the pipeline calibration state using the tasks
h_export_calstate and h_import_calstate.

Output:

results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned

Parameter List

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets in the pipeline context.
        | example: ['X227.ms']
    * - field
      - | A string containing the list of field names or field ids to which the calibration will be applied. Defaults to all fields in the pipeline
        | context.
        | example: '3C279', '3C279, M82'
    * - intent
      - | A string containing the list of intents against which the selected fields will be matched. Defaults to all supported intents
        | in the pipeline context.
        | example: `'*TARGET*'`
    * - spw
      - | The list of spectral windows and channels to which the calibration will be applied. Defaults to all science windows in the pipeline
        | context.
        | example: '17', '11, 15'
    * - antenna
      - | The selection of antennas to which the calibration will be applied. Defaults to all antennas. Not currently supported.
    * - parang
      - | Apply parallactic angle correction
    * - applymode
      - | Calibration apply mode 'calflag': calibrate data and apply flags from solutions
        | 'calflagstrict': (default) same as above except flag spws for which calibration is
        | unavailable in one or more tables (instead of allowing them to pass
        | uncalibrated and unflagged)
        | 'trial': report on flags from solutions, dataset entirely unchanged
        | 'flagonly': apply flags from solutions only, data not calibrated
        | 'flagonlystrict': same as above except flag spws for which calibration is
        | unavailable in one or more tables
        | 'calonly': calibrate data only, flags from solutions NOT applied
    * - calwt
      - | Calibrate the weights as well as the data
    * - flagbackup
      - | Backup the flags before the apply
    * - flagsum
      - | Compute before and after flagging summary statistics
    * - flagdetailedsum
      - | Compute detailed before and after flagging statistics summaries. Parameter available only when if flagsum is True.
    * - parallel
      - | Execute using CASA HPC functionality, if available. options: 'automatic', 'true', 'false', True, False
        | default: None (equivalent to False)
