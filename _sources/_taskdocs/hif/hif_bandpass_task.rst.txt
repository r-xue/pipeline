hif_bandpass
============

Task description
-----------------
Compute amplitude and phase as a function of frequency for each spectral
window in each MeasurementSet.

Previous calibration can be applied on the fly.

hif_bandpass computes a bandpass solution for every specified science
spectral window. By default a 'phaseup' pre-calibration is performed
and applied on the fly to the data, before the bandpass is computed.

The hif_refant task may be used to precompute a prioritized list of
reference antennas.


Output

results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 50
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: longtable

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
        | '': use all MeasurementSets in the context
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - caltable
      - | The list of output calibration tables. Defaults to the standard pipeline naming convention.
        | Example: caltable=['M82.gcal', 'M82B.gcal']
    * - field
      - | The list of field names or field ids for which bandpasses are computed. Defaults to all fields.
        | Examples: field='3C279', field='3C279, M82'
    * - intent
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against which the selected fields are matched.  Defaults to all data
        | with bandpass intent.
        | Example: intent='`*PHASE*`'
    * - spw
      - | The list of spectral windows and channels for which bandpasses are computed. Defaults to all science spectral windows.
        | Example: spw='11,13,15,17'
    * - antenna
      - | Set of data selection antenna IDs
    * - phaseup
      - | Do a phaseup on the data before computing the bandpass solution.
    * - phaseupsolint
      - | The phase correction solution interval in CASA syntax. Used when phaseup is True.
        | Example: phaseupsolint=300
    * - phaseupbw
      - | Bandwidth to be used for phaseup. Defaults to 500MHz. Used when phaseup is True.
        | Examples: phaseupbw='' to use entire bandpass
        | phaseupbw='500MHz' to use central 500MHz
    * - solint
      - | Time and channel solution intervals in CASA syntax. Examples: solint='inf,10ch', 'inf'
    * - combine
      - | Data axes to combine for solving. Axes are '', 'scan', 'spw', 'field' or any comma-separated combination.
        | Example: combine='scan,field'
    * - refant
      - | Reference antenna names. Defaults to the value(s) stored in the pipeline context. If undefined in the pipeline context
        | defaults to the CASA reference antenna naming scheme.
        | Examples: refant='DV01', refant='DV06,DV07'
    * - solnorm
      - | Normalise the bandpass solution
    * - minblperant
      - | Minimum number of baselines required per antenna for each solve. Antennas with fewer baselines are excluded from
        | solutions.
    * - minsnr
      - | Reject solutions below this SNR


Examples 
--------
1. Compute a channel bandpass for all visibility files in the pipeline
context using the CASA reference antenna determination scheme:

>>> hif_bandpass()

2. Same as the above but precompute a prioritized reference antenna list:

>>> hif_refant()
>>> hif_bandpass()
