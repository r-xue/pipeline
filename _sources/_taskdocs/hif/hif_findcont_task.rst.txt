hif_findcont
============

Task description
-----------------
Find continuum frequency ranges for a list of specified targets.

If the cont.dat file is not already present in the working directory, then dirty image
cubes are created for each spectral window of each science target at the native channel
resolution unless the ``nbins`` parameter was used in the preceding hif_makeimlist stage.
Robust=1 Briggs weighting is used for optimal line sensitivity, even if a different
robust had been chosen in hifa_imageprecheck to match the PI requested angular resolution.
Using moment0 and moment8 images of each cube, SNR-based masks are created, and the mean
spectrum of the joint mask is computed and evaluated with extensive heuristics to find the
channel ranges that are likely to be free of line emission.  Warnings are generated if
the channel ranges contain a small fraction of the bandwidth, or sample only a limited
extent of the spectrum.

If the cont.dat file already exists in the working directory before this task is executed,
then it will first examine the contents. For any spw that already has frequency ranges
defined in this file, it will not perform the analysis described above in favor of the
a priori ranges. For spws not listed in a pre-existing file, it will analyze them as
normal and update the file. In either case, the cont.dat file is used by the subsequent
hif_uvcontsub and hif_makeimages stages.

results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
        | '': use all MeasurementSets in the context
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - target_list
      - | Dictionary specifying targets to be imaged; blank will read list from context
    * - hm_mosweight
      - | Mosaic weighting Defaults to '' to enable the automatic heuristics calculation.
        | Can be set to True or False manually.
    * - hm_perchanweightdensity
      - | Calculate the weight density for each channel independently Defaults to '' to enable the automatic heuristics calculation.
        | Can be set to True or False manually.
    * - hm_weighting
      - | Weighting scheme (natural,uniform,briggs,briggsabs[experimental],briggsbwtaper[experimental])
    * - datacolumn
      - | Data column to image. Only to be used for manual overriding when the automatic choice by data type is not appropriate.
    * - parallel
      - | Use MPI cluster where possible
