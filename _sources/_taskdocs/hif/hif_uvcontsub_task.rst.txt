hif_uvcontsub
=============

Task description
-----------------
hif_uvcontsub fits the continuum for the frequency ranges given in the cont.dat
file, subtracts that fit from the uv data and generates a new set of MSes
containing the continuum subtracted (i.e. line) data. The fit is attempted
for all science targets and spws. If a fit is impossible, the corresponding
data selection is not written to the output line MS.

    * - parameter name
      - description
    * - vis
      - | The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
        | '': use all MeasurementSets in the context
        | Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    * - field
      - | The list of field names or field ids for which UV continuum fits are computed. Defaults to all fields.
        | Examples: '3C279', '3C279,M82'
    * - intent
      - | A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against which the selected fields are matched.
        | '': Defaults to all data with TARGET intent.
    * - spw
      - | The list of spectral windows and channels for which uv continuum fits are computed.
        | '', Defaults to all science spectral windows.
        | Example: '11,13,15,17'
    * - fitorder
      - | Polynomial order for the continuum fits per source and spw. Defaults to {} which means fit order 1 for all sources and
        | spws. If an explicit dictionary is given then all unspecified
        | selections still default to 1.
        | Example: {'3C279': {'15': 1, '17': 2}, 'M82': {'13': 2}}
    * - parallel
      - | Execute using CASA HPC functionality, if available.


Examples 
--------
1. Fit and subtract continuum for all science targets and spws

>>> hif_uvcontsub()

2. Fit and subtract continuum only for a subsect of fields

>>> hif_uvcontsub(field='3C279,M82'

3. Fit and subtract continuum only for a subsect of spws

>>> hif_uvcontsub(spw='11,13')

4. Override automatic fit order choice

>>> hif_uvcontsub(fitorder={'3C279': {'15': 1, '17': 2}, 'M82': {'13': 2}})
