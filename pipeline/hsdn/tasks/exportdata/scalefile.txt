# 1. General Information
# This is a template file for scaling correction (the valiation of intensity sensitivity between beams) used in hsdn_restoredata task of CASA pipeline.
# If this file is not input, the scaling correction is skipped.
# The default values of scaling factor are set to 1.0, which means no correction is applied. 
# This file consists of three parts: "1. General Information", "2. Meta Data" and "3. CSV Data".
#
# 2. Meta Data:
# Meta Data is the information about the origin of the scaling factors.
# The values filled by you are displayed in the weblog detail page of hsdn_restoredata task, however blanks are allowed.
# Do not make new line for each. 
# MS: The ID of measurement set data of which are used for estimating the scaling factors.
# ObjectName: The name of object to have been observed in the MS.
# ObservationStart: The year, month, day, hour, minutes and second of the observation start for the measurement set data.
# Software: The software name (and the version) to have been used for the processing of the MS. ex. CASA X.Y.Z with pipeline
# ProcessStart: The year, month, day, hour, minutes and second of the first pipeline processing start.
# AuthorName: Your name (first and last) or the author's name who have made the meta data.
# FreeMemo: Memo for making the scaling factors.

# 3. CSV Data:
# CSV Data is the list that you would like to apply the scaling correction to the MS data.
# It must be CSV format and be consist of the column definition and the data.
# The column definition must be ordered as follows: MS,Beam,Spwid,Polarization,Factor
# MS: The ID of measurement set data.
# Beam: The ID of beam.
# Spwid: The ID of spectral window.
# Polarization: The name of polarization; four cross correlation parameters, i.e., XX, YY, XY or YX.
# Factor: The scaling factors. They are the reciprocal of the relative intensities compared to the standard value.
# The data must be ordered the same as the column definition without the beginning "#".
# The data are automatically filled, however you should replace the Factor values (preset:1.0) with the measured values to do the scaling correction.
