    """Flag the flux, diffgain, phase calibrators and check source

    This task computes the flagging heuristics on the flux, diffgain, and phase
    calibrators and the check source, by calling hif_correctedampflag which
    looks for outlier visibility points by statistically examining the scalar
    difference of corrected amplitudes minus model amplitudes, and flags those
    outliers. The philosophy is that only outlier data points that have remained
    outliers after calibration will be flagged. The heuristic works equally well
    on resolved calibrators and point sources because it is not performing a
    vector difference, and thus is not sensitive to nulls in the flux density
    vs. uvdistance domain. Note that the phase of the data is not assessed.

    In further detail, the workflow is as follows: a snapshot of the flagging
    state is preserved at the start, a preliminary phase and amplitude gaincal
    solution is solved and applied, the flagging heuristics are run and
    any outliers are marked for flagging, the flagging state is restored from the
    snapshot. If any outliers were found, then these are flagged. Plots are
    generated at two points in this workflow: after preliminary phase and
    amplitude calibration but before flagging heuristics are run, and after
    flagging heuristics have been run and applied. If no points were flagged,
    the 'after' plots are not generated or displayed. The score for this stage
    is the standard data flagging score, which depends on the fraction of data
    flagged.

    Args:
        vis: The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
            MeasurementSets specified in the pipeline context.
            Example: vis=['M51.ms']

        intent: A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against
            which the selected fields are matched. If undefined (default), it
            will select all data with the AMPLITUDE, PHASE, and CHECK intents,
            except for one case: if one of the AMPLITUDE intent fields was also
            used for BANDPASS, then this task will select only data with PHASE
            and CHECK intents.
            Example: intent='`*PHASE*`'

        phaseupsolint: The phase correction solution interval in CASA syntax.
            Example: phaseupsolint='300s'

        solint: Time and channel solution intervals in CASA syntax.
            Example: solint='inf,10ch', solint='inf'

        minsnr: Solutions below this SNR are rejected.

        refant: Reference antenna names. Defaults to the value(s) stored in the
            pipeline context. If undefined in the pipeline context defaults to
            the CASA reference antenna naming scheme.
            Example: refant='DV01', refant='DV06,DV07'

        antnegsig: Lower sigma threshold for identifying outliers as a result of
            bad antennas within individual timestamps.
            Example: antnegsig=4.0

        antpossig: Upper sigma threshold for identifying outliers as a result of
            bad antennas within individual timestamps.
            Example: antpossig=4.6

        tmantint: Threshold for maximum fraction of timestamps that are allowed to
            contain outliers.
            Example: tmantint=0.063

        tmint: Threshold for maximum fraction of "outlier timestamps" over
            "total timestamps" that a baseline may be a part of.
            Example: tmint=0.085

        tmbl: Initial threshold for maximum fraction of "bad baselines" over "all
            baselines" that an antenna may be a part of.
            Example: tmbl=0.175

        antblnegsig: Lower sigma threshold for identifying outliers as a result of
            "bad baselines" and/or "bad antennas" within baselines, across all
            timestamps.
            Example: antblnegsig=3.4

        antblpossig: Threshold for identifying outliers as a result of
            "bad baselines" and/or "bad antennas" within baselines, across all
            timestamps.
            Example: antblpossig=3.2

        relaxed_factor: Relaxed value to set the threshold scaling factor to under
            certain conditions (see task description).
            Example: relaxed_factor=2.0

        niter: Maximum number of times to iterate on evaluation of flagging
            heuristics. If an iteration results in no new flags, then subsequent
            iterations are skipped.
            Example: niter=2

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. run with recommended settings to create flux scale calibration with flagging
        using recommended thresholds:
