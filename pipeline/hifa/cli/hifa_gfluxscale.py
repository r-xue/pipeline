    hifa_gfluxscale ---- Derive flux density scales from standard calibrators

    
    Derive flux densities for point source transfer calibrators using flux models
    for reference calibrators.
    
    Flux values are determined by:
    
    - computing phase only solutions for all the science spectral windows
      using the calibrator data selected by the ``reference`` and ``refintent``
      parameters and the ``transfer`` and ``transintent`` parameters, the value
      of the ``phaseupsolint`` parameter, and any spw combination determined
      in hifa_spwphaseup.
    
    - computing complex amplitude only solutions for all the science spectral
      windows using calibrator data selected with ``reference`` and
      ``refintent`` parameters and the ``transfer`` and ``transintent``
      parameters, the value of the ``solint`` parameter.
    
    - transferring the flux scale from the reference calibrators to the transfer
      calibrators using ``refspwmap`` for windows without data in the reference
      calibrators.
    
    - inserting the computed flux density values into the MODEL_DATA column.
    
    Resolved calibrators are handled via antenna selection either automatically
    (``hm_resolvedcals`` = 'automatic') or manually (``hm_resolvedcals`` =
    'manual'). In the former case, antennas closer to the reference antenna than
    the uv distance where visibilities fall to ``peak_fraction`` of the peak are
    used. In manual mode, the antennas specified in ``antenna`` are used.
    
    Note that the flux corrected calibration table computed internally is
    not currently used in later pipeline apply calibration steps.

    Output:

        results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

                    Vector of spectral window ids enabling scaling across
                    spectral windows. Defaults to no scaling.

                    fields in 0,1,2,3
    reffile
                    Path to a file containing flux densities for calibrators.
                    Setjy will be run for any that have both reference and transfer intents.
                    Values given in this file will take precedence over MODEL column values
                    set by previous tasks. By default, the path is set to the CSV file created
                    by hifa_importdata, consisting of catalogue fluxes extracted from the ASDM
                    and / or edited by the user.
                    
                    example: reffile='', reffile='working/flux.csv'
    phaseupsolint
