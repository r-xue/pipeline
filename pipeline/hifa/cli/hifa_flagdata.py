    hifa_flagdata ---- Do meta data based flagging of a list of MeasurementSets.

    
    The hifa_flagdata data performs basic flagging operations on a list of
    measurements including:
    
    o applying online flags
    o applying a flagging template
    o partial polarization flagging
    o autocorrelation data flagging
    o shadowed antenna data flagging
    o scan-based flagging by intent or scan number
    o edge channel flagging, as needed
    o low atmospheric transmission flagging
    
    About the spectral window edge channel flagging:
    
    o For TDM spectral windows, a number of edge channels are always flagged,
    according to the fracspw and fracspwfps parameters (the latter operates only
    on spectral windows with 62, 124, or 248 channels). With the default setting
    of fracspw, the number of channels flagged on each edge is 2, 4, or 8 for 64,
    128, or 256-channel spectral windows, respectively.
    
    o For most FDM spectral windows, no edge flagging is done. The only exceptions
    are ACA spectral windows that encroach too close to the baseband edge.
    Channels that lie closer to the baseband edge than the following values are
    flagged: 62.5, 40, 20, 10, and 5 MHz for spectral windows with bandwidths of
    1000, 500, 250, 125, and 62.5 MHz, respectively. A warning is generated in
    the weblog if flagging occurs due to proximity to the baseband edge.
    By definition, 2000 MHz spectral windows always encroach the baseband edge on
    both sides of the spectral window, and thus are always flagged on both sides
    in order to achieve 1875 MHz bandwidth (in effect, they are flagged by
    62.5 MHz on each side), and thus no warning is generated.

    results -- If pipeline mode is 'getinputs' then None is returned. Otherwise
    the results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    vis                The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
                       MeasurementSets defined in the pipeline context.
    autocorr           Flag autocorrelation data.
    shadow             Flag shadowed antennas.
    tolerance          Amount of antenna shadowing tolerated, in meters. A positive number
                       allows antennas to overlap in projection. A negative number forces antennas
                       apart in projection. Zero implies a distance of radius_1+radius_2 between
                       antenna centers.
    scan               Flag a list of specified scans.
    scannumber         A string containing a comma delimited list of scans to be
                       flagged.
                       
                       example: scannumber='3,5,6'
    intents            A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against
                       which the scans to be flagged are matched.
                       
                       example: intents='*BANDPASS*'
    edgespw            Flag the edge spectral window channels.
    fracspw            Fraction of channels to flag at both edges of TDM spectral windows.
    fracspwfps         Fraction of channels to flag at both edges of ACA TDM
                       spectral windows that were created with the earlier (original)
                       implementation of the frequency profile synthesis (FPS) algorithm.
    online             Apply the online flags.
    partialpol         Identify integrations in multi-polarisation data where part
                       of the polarization products are already flagged, and flag the other
                       polarization products in those integrations.
    lowtrans           Flag spectral windows for which a significant fraction of the
                       channels have atmospheric transmission below the threshold (mintransrepspw,
                       mintransnonrepspws).
    mintransnonrepspws This atmospheric transmissivity threshold is used to flag
                       a non-representative science spectral window when more than 60% of
                       its channels have a transmissivity below this level.
    mintransrepspw     This atmospheric transmissivity threshold is used to flag the
                       representative science spectral window when more than 60% of its channels
                       have a transmissivity below this level.
    fileonline         File containing the online flags. These are computed by the
                       h_init or hif_importdata data tasks. If the online flags files
                       are undefined a name of the form 'msname.flagonline.txt' is assumed.
    template           Apply flagging templates
    filetemplate       The name of a text file that contains the flagging template
                       for RFI, birdies, telluric lines, etc. If the template flags files
                       is undefined a name of the form 'msname.flagtemplate.txt' is assumed.
    hm_tbuff           The heuristic for computing the default time interval padding
                       parameter. The options are 'halfint' and 'manual'. In 'halfint' mode tbuff
                       is set to half the maximum of the median integration time of the science
                       and calibrator target observations. The value of 0.048 seconds is
                       subtracted from the lower time limit to accommodate the behavior of the
                       ALMA Control system.
    tbuff              The time in seconds used to pad flagging command time intervals if
                       hm_tbuff='manual'. The default in manual mode is no flagging.
    qa0                QA0 flags.
    qa2                QA2 flags.
    pipelinemode       The pipeline operating mode. In 'automatic' mode the pipeline
                       determines the values of all context defined pipeline inputs automatically.
                       In interactive mode the user can set the pipeline context defined parameters
                       manually. In 'getinputs' mode the user can check the settings of all
                       pipeline parameters without running the task.
    flagbackup         Back up any pre-existing flags.
    dryrun             Run the commands (True) or generate the commands to be run but do not
                       execute (False).
    acceptresults      Add the results of the task to the pipeline context (True) or
                       reject them (False).
