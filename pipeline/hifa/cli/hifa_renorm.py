    hifa_renorm ---- ALMA renormalization task

    This task makes an assessment, and optionally applies a correction, to data
    suffering from incorrect amplitude normalization caused by bright
    astronomical lines detected in the autocorrelations of some target sources.

    For a full description of the effects of bright emission lines and the
    correction heuristics used in this task, please see the Pipeline User Guide.

    Output:

        results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    vis
                     List of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
                     MeasurementSets specified in the pipeline context.

                     Example: vis=['ngc5921.ms']
    apply
                     Boolean to select whether to apply the renormalization
                     correction (True), or only run the assessment (False,
                     default).

                     Example: apply=True
    threshold
                     Apply correction if max correction is above this threshold
                     value and ``apply`` = True. Default is 1.02 (i.e. 2%).

                     Example: threshold=1.02
    correctATM
                     Use the ATM model transmission profiles to try and correct
                     for any ATM residual features that get into the scaling
                     spectra.

    spw
                     The list of real (not virtual - i.e. the actual spwIDs in
                     the MS) spectral windows to evaluate.

                     Set to spw='' by default, which means the task will select
                     all relevant (science FDM) spectral windows.

                     Note that for data with multiple MSs, a list with the
                     correct spectral window selection for each MS can be
                     provided.

                     Examples:

                     spw="11,13,15,17"

                     spw=["11,13,15,17", "5,7,11,13"]
    excludechan
                     Channels to exclude in either channel or frequency space
                     (TOPO, GHz), specifying the real (not virtual) spectral
                     window per selection.

                     Note that for data with multiple MSs, a list of
                     dictionaries with the correct selection for each MS can be
                     provided.

                     Examples:

                     excludechan={'22':'100~150;800~850', '24':'100~200'}

                     excludechan={'22':'230.1GHz~230.2GHz'}

                     excludechan=[{'22':'100~150'}, {'15':'100~150'}]
    atm_auto_exclude
                     Automatically find and exclude regions with atmospheric
                     features. Default is False
    bwthreshspw
                     Bandwidth beyond which a SPW is split into chunks to fit
                     separately. The default value for all SPWs is 120e6, and
                     this parameter allows one to override it for specific SPWs,
                     due to needing potentially various 'nsegments' when EBs
                     have very different SPW bandwidths.

                     Example: bwthreshspw={'16: 64e6, '22: 64e6}
    parallel
                     Execute using CASA HPC functionality, if available.

    --------- examples -----------------------------------------------------------

    1. Run with recommended settings to assess the need for an ALMA amplitude
    renormalization correction.

    >>> hifa_renorm()

    2. Run to assess the necessary ALMA amplitude renormalization correction,
    and apply this correction if it exceeds a threshold of 3% (1.03).

    >>> hifa_renorm(apply=True, threshold=1.03)
