    """Determine temporal gains from calibrator observations.

    The time-dependent complex gains for each antenna/spw are determined from
    the raw data (DATA column) divided by the model (MODEL column), for the
    specified fields. The gains are computed according to the spw
    mapping/combination, solint, and gaintype as determined in hifa_spwphaseup.

    Previous calibrations are applied on the fly.

    The process to solve for the various complex gains follows:

    - Phase solutions are produced for all intents (excluding the CHECK intent)
      using the spw mapping/combination and gaintype determined in 
      hifa_spwphaseup, and using solint = 'inf' (per scan). The solutions
      only registered for the PHASE intent to transfer to itself (PHASE intent)
      and the TARGET (and CHECK) intent(s) in hif_applycal.
 
    - Phase (phase-up) solutions are produced for all intents using the spw mapping/
      combination, solint (typically 'int' if not low SNR data) and gaintype as 
      determined in hifa_spwphaseup. The solutions are used for (1) on-the-fly
      application as to solve the subsequent amplitude gains, (2) final phase
      correction in hif_applycal of the BANDPASS, AMPLITUDE, DIFFGAIN,
      POLARIZATION intents (i.e. after hif_applycal, those intents are
      self-calibrated but PHASE and CHECK are not.) These short-solint phases
      are also shown as ``diagnostic`` plots. 

    - Amplitude solutions are produced for all calibrator intents with the above 
      phase-up solutions pre-applied. The time solint is 'inf' (scan), so solutions
      are found for each scan and spw. The solutions are registered for AMP gain
      correction of all intents to themselves, and the PHASE intent to the TARGET
      and CHECK intent(s). Note: for band-to-band observations, there are no
      'high frequency' observations of the PHASE intent, and the full AMP gains are
      transferred from the AMPLITUDE intent to the TARGET and CHECK intent(s).

    - Short term ``diagnostic`` amplitude solutions are produced for all calibrator 
      intents using the same short solint as that used for the PHASE intent
      phase-up (typically 'int' except for low SNR cases). These solutions are
      plotted but not applied.

    - Diagnostic phase offsets solutions are produced with solint='inf' for
      the BANDPASS and PHASE intent, first solving and preapplying the phase
      as a function of time with combine='spw' (to ``zero`` the phases),
      and then then solving phase(time) per spw.
      Note: by definition the BANDPASS phase will be exactly zero. The phase
      solutions for the PHASE intent are used by QA heuristics to identify jumps
      and drifts of the spw-spw offsets as a function of time, but if the SNR
      is very low, such offsets will not be able to detected.
    
    Good candidate reference antennas were determined using the hif_refant task.
    During all solutions for standard observing modes, the reference antenna can
    change flexibly. For polarization observations a good, un-flagged common
    reference antenna is found and locked in time. For band-to-band observations,
    all solutions are also made strictly enforcing the use of the selected
    reference antenna.
    
    Previous calibrations that have been stored in the pipeline context are
    applied on the fly. 

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.
