    hifa_antpos ---- Derive an antenna position calibration table


    The hifa_antpos task corrects the antenna positions recorded in the ASDMs using
    updated antenna position calibration information determined after the
    observation was taken.
    
    Corrections can be input by hand, read from a file on disk, or in the future
    by querying an ALMA database service.
    
    The antenna positions file is in 'csv' format containing 6 comma-delimited
    columns as shown below. This file should not include blank lines, including
    after the end of the last entry. The default name of this file is 'antennapos.csv'.
    
    Example of contents for an 'antennapos.csv' file:
    
        ms,antenna,xoffset,yoffset,zoffset,comment

        uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e.ms,DV11,0.000,0.010,0.000,"No comment"

        uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e.dup.ms,DV11,0.000,-0.010,0.000,"No comment"

    The offset values in this file are in meters.
    
    The corrections are used to generate a calibration table which is recorded
    in the pipeline context and applied to the raw visibility data, on the fly to
    generate other calibration tables, or permanently to generate calibrated
    visibilities for imaging.
    
    Note: the ``hm_antpos`` 'online' option will be implemented when the
    observing system provides an antenna position determination service.

    Output:

        results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    vis
                  List of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
                  MeasurementSets specified in the pipeline context.
                  
                  Example: vis=['ngc5921.ms']
    caltable
                  List of names for the output calibration tables. Defaults
                  to the standard pipeline naming convention.
                  
                  Example: caltable=['ngc5921.gcal']
    hm_antpos
                  Heuristics method for retrieving the antenna position
                  corrections. The options are 'online' (not yet implemented),
                  'manual', and 'file'.
                  
                  Example: hm_antpos='manual'
    antenna
                  The list of antennas for which the positions are to be corrected
                  if ``hm_antpos`` is 'manual'.
                  
                  Example: antenna='DV05,DV07'
    offsets
                  The list of antenna offsets for each antenna in 'antennas'.
                  Each offset is a set of 3 floating point numbers separated by
                  commas, specified in the ITRF frame.
                  
                  Example: offsets=[0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01]
    antposfile
                  The file(s) containing the antenna offsets. Used if
                  ``hm_antpos`` is 'file'.
    dryrun
                  Run the commands (True) or generate the commands to be run but
                  do not execute (False).
    acceptresults
                  Automatically accept the results of the task into the pipeline
                  context (True) or reject them (False).
    threshold
                  Highlight antenna position offsets greater than this value in
                  the weblog. Units are wavelengths and the default is 1.0.
                  
                  Example: threshold=1.0

    --------- examples -----------------------------------------------------------

    1. Correct the position of antenna 'DV05' for all the visibility files in a
    single pipeline run:
    
    >>> hifa_antpos(antenna='DV05', offsets=[0.01, 0.02, 0.03])
    
    2. Correct the position of antennas for all the visibility files in a single
    pipeline run using antenna positions files on disk. These files are assumed
    to conform to a default naming scheme if 'antposfile' is unspecified by the
    user:
    
    >>> hifa_antpos(hm_antpos='file', antposfile='myantposfile.csv')
