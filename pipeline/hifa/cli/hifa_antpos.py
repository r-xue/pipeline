    """Derive an antenna position calibration table

    The hifa_antpos task corrects the antenna positions recorded in the ASDMs using
    updated antenna position calibration information determined after the
    observation was taken.

    Corrections can be input by hand, read from a file on disk, or in the future
    by querying an ALMA database service.

    The antenna positions file is in 'csv' format containing 6 comma-delimited
    columns as shown below. This file should not include blank lines, including
    after the end of the last entry. The default name of this file is 'antennapos.csv'.

    Example of contents for an 'antennapos.csv' file:

        ms,antenna,xoffset,yoffset,zoffset,comment

        uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e.ms,DV11,0.000,0.010,0.000,"No comment"

        uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e.dup.ms,DV11,0.000,-0.010,0.000,"No comment"

    The offset values in this file are in meters.

    The corrections are used to generate a calibration table which is recorded
    in the pipeline context and applied to the raw visibility data, on the fly to
    generate other calibration tables, or permanently to generate calibrated
    visibilities for imaging.

    Note: the ``hm_antpos`` 'online' option will be implemented when the
    observing system provides an antenna position determination service.

    Args:
        vis: List of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
            MeasurementSets specified in the pipeline context.
            Example: vis=['ngc5921.ms']

        caltable: List of names for the output calibration tables. Defaults
            to the standard pipeline naming convention.
            Example: caltable=['ngc5921.gcal']

        hm_antpos: Heuristics method for retrieving the antenna position
            corrections. The options are 'online' (not yet implemented),
            'manual', and 'file'.
            Example: hm_antpos='manual'

        antenna: The list of antennas for which the positions are to be corrected
            if ``hm_antpos`` is 'manual'.
            Example: antenna='DV05,DV07'

        offsets: The list of antenna offsets for each antenna in 'antennas'.
            Each offset is a set of 3 floating point numbers separated by
            commas, specified in the ITRF frame.
            Example: offsets=[0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01]

        antposfile: The file(s) containing the antenna offsets. Used if
            ``hm_antpos`` is 'file'.

        threshold: Highlight antenna position offsets greater than this value in
            the weblog. Units are wavelengths and the default is 1.0.
            Example: threshold=1.0

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Correct the position of antenna 'DV05' for all the visibility files in a
        single pipeline run:

        >>> hifa_antpos(antenna='DV05', offsets=[0.01, 0.02, 0.03])

        2. Correct the position of antennas for all the visibility files in a single
        pipeline run using antenna positions files on disk. These files are assumed
        to conform to a default naming scheme if ``antposfile`` is unspecified by the
        user:

        >>> hifa_antpos(hm_antpos='file', antposfile='myantposfile.csv')
