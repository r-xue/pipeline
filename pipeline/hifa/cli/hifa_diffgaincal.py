    hifa_diffgaincal ---- Derive SpW phase offsets from differential gain calibrator.

    This task creates the spectral window phase gain offset table used to allow
    calibrating the "science" spectral setup with phase gains from a "reference"
    spectral setup. A bright point source Quasar, called the Differential Gain
    Calibrator (DIFFGAIN) source, is used for this purpose. The DIFFGAIN is
    typically observed in groups of interleaved "reference" and "science" scans,
    once at the start and once at the end of the observations. In very long
    observations, there may be a group of scans occurring during the middle.
    Scan groups are combined while solving for SpW offsets between "reference"
    and "science" spectral setups.

    Output:

        results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

                    The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
                    MeasurementSets specified in the pipeline context.
