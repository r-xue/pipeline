def hifa_diffgaincal(vis=None):
    """Derive SpW phase offsets from differential gain calibrator.

    This task creates the spectral window phase gain offset table used to allow
    calibrating the "on-source" spectral setup with phase gains from a
    "reference" spectral setup. A bright point source Quasar, called the
    Differential Gain Calibrator (DIFFGAIN) source, is used for this purpose.
    This DIFFGAIN source typically observed in groups of interleaved "reference"
    and "on-source" scans, once at the start and once at the end of the
    observations. In very long observations, there may be a group of scans
    occurring during the middle. Scan groups are combined while solving for SpW
    offsets between "reference" and "on-source" spectral setups.

    Parameters:
        vis: The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
            MeasurementSets specified in the pipeline context.
            Example: ['M32A.ms', 'M32B.ms']

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Derive SpW phase offsets from differential gain calibrator.
