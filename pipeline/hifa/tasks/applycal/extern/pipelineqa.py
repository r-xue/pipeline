        QAScore represent a normalised assessment of data quality.

        The QA score is normalised to the range 0.0 to 1.0. Any score outside
        this range will be truncated at presentation time to lie within this
        range.

        The long message may be rendered on the task detail page, depending on
        whether this score is considered significant and the rendering hints
        given by the weblog_location argument.

        The short message associated with a QA score is used on the task
        summary page when this task is considered representative for the stage.

        A QAScore is derived from an unnormalised metric, which should be
        provided as the 'origin' argument when available. These metrics may be
        exported to the AQUA report, depending on their significance to the
        task QA and whether AQUA metric export is enabled for the particular
        task.

        The weblog_location and hierarchy attributes are intended to be used
        together, set by appropriate task-specific aggregation logic in the
        QAPlugin code, to specify how this score should be aggregated in
        overall score calculations and if/how it should be presented in the
        weblog.

        The hierarchy attribute should be in dotted string format, e.g.,
        'amp_vs_freq.amp.slope'. QAPlugins use this metadata to organise how
        the score should be grouped for processing and aggregation.
