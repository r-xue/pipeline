        """Initialize Inputs.

        Args:
            context: Pipeline context.

            vis: The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
                MeasurementSets specified in the pipeline context.

                Example: vis=['M82A.ms', 'M82B.ms']

            output_dir: Output directory.
                Defaults to None, which corresponds to the current working directory.

            caltable: The list of output calibration tables. Defaults to the standard
                pipeline naming convention.

                Example: caltable=['M82.gcal', 'M82B.gcal']

            intent: A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against
                which the selected fields are matched. Defaults to the BANDPASS
                observations.

                Example: intent='PHASE'

            hm_spwmapmode: The spectral window mapping mode. The options are: 'auto',
                'combine', 'simple', and 'default'. In 'auto' mode hifa_spwphaseup
                estimates the SNR of the phase calibrator observations and uses these
                estimates to choose between 'combine' mode (low SNR) and 'default' mode
                (high SNR). In combine mode all spectral windows are combined and mapped to
                one spectral window. In 'simple' mode narrow spectral windows are mapped to
                wider ones using an algorithm defined by 'maxnarrowbw', 'minfracmaxbw', and
                'samebb'. In 'default' mode the spectral window map defaults to the
                standard one to one mapping.

                Example: hm_spwmapmode='combine'

            phasesnr: The required phase gaincal solution signal-to-noise.

                Example: phasesnr=20.0

            intphasesnr: The required solint='int' phase gaincal solution signal-to-noise.

                Example: intphasesnr=4.0

            intphasesnrmin: The required solint='int' phase gaincal solution
                signal-to-noise for fields that cover the AMPLITUDE calibrator
                intent.

                Example: intphasesnrmin=3.0

            phaseupmaxsolint: Maximum phase correction solution interval (in
                seconds) allowed in very low-SNR cases. Used only when
                ``hm_spwmapmode`` = 'auto' or 'combine'.

                Example: phaseupmaxsolint=60.0

            bwedgefrac: The fraction of the bandwidth edges that is flagged.

                Example: bwedgefrac=0.0

            hm_nantennas: The heuristics for determines the number of antennas to use
                in the signal-to-noise estimate. The options are 'all' and 'unflagged'.
                The 'unflagged' options is not currently supported.

                Example: hm_nantennas='unflagged'

            maxfracflagged: The maximum fraction of an antenna that can be flagged
                before it is excluded from the signal-to-noise estimate.

                Example: maxfracflagged=0.80

            maxnarrowbw: The maximum bandwidth defining narrow spectral windows. Values
                must be in CASA compatible frequency units.

                Example: maxnarrowbw=''

            minfracmaxbw: The minimum fraction of the maximum bandwidth in the set of
                spws to use for matching.

                Example: minfracmaxbw=0.75

            samebb: Match within the same baseband if possible.

                Example: samebb=False

            unregister_existing: Unregister previous spwphaseup calibrations from the pipeline context
                before registering the new calibrations from this task.

            field: The list of field names or field ids for which phase offset solutions
                are to be computed. Defaults to all fields with the default intent.

                Example: field='3C279', field='3C279, M82'

            spw: The list of spectral windows and channels for which gain solutions are
                computed. Defaults to all the science spectral windows.

                Example: spw='13,15'

            combine: Data axes to combine for solving. Options are '', 'scan', 'spw',
                'field' or any comma-separated combination.

                Example: combine=''

            refant: Reference antenna name(s) in priority order. Defaults to most recent
                values set in the pipeline context.  If no reference antenna is defined in
                the pipeline context the CASA defaults are used.

                Example: refant='DV01', refant='DV05,DV07'

            minblperant: Minimum number of baselines required per antenna for each solve.
                Antennas with fewer baselines are excluded from solutions.

                Example: minblperant=2

            minsnr: Solutions below this SNR are rejected.

        Compute the optimal solution interval and gaintype.

        Computes the optimal values to use for solution interval and gaintype
        in phase-up gaincal solutions. The ideal solution interval is a single
        integration time interval (solint='int'), but this method uses the SNR
        estimates provided to ensure that sufficient SNR is achieved, or whether
        some amount of time averaging (i.e. solint > 'int') is necessary.

        spwids, snrs, ref_times, and int_times are all passed from the SNR test
        function, where SNRs are based on the reference time (ref_times), and
        int_times is provided as the integration time (for each SpW).

        The mappingmode indicates what type of spw mapping is used in the
        phase-up solve:

          * single: uses no mapping (each spw mapped to itself); in this case,
            the value of the lowest (worst) SNR will be used.
          * mapping: uses spw re-mapping; in this case, the highest SNR will be
            used, as low-SNR SpWs will be re-mapped to this highest SNR SpW.
          * combine: uses spw combination; in this case, linearalg is used to
            compute the combined SNR that is then used to govern the solint.

        Args:
            spwids: List of the spectral window IDs.
            snrs: List of the SNR per SpW, calculated for the reference time.
            ref_times: List of the reference time per SPW, in minutes.
