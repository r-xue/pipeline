<%block name="title">Select Polarisation Reference Antennas</%block>

<p>
    This task re-evaluates the reference antenna lists from all measurement
    sets within a polarisation session and combines these into a single common
    reference antenna list, that is to be used by any subsequent pipeline
    stages.
