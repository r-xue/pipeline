    hsd_atmcor ---- Apply offline ATM correction to the data.

    The hsd_atmcor task provides the capability of offline correction of
    residual atmospheric features in the calibrated single-dish spectra
    originated from incomplete calibration mainly due to a difference of
    elevation angles between ON_SOURCE and OFF_SOURCE measurements.

    Optimal atmospheric model is automatically determined by default
    (atmtype = 'auto'). You may specify desired atmospheric model by giving
    either single integer (apply to all EBs) or a list of integers (models
    per EB) to atmtype parameter. Please see parameter description for the
    meanings of integer values.

    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    atmtype       Type of atmospheric transmission model represented as an integer.
                  Available options are as follows. Integer values can be given as
                  either integer or string, i.e. both 1 and '1' are acceptable.

                    'auto': perform heuristics to choose best model (default)
                         1: tropical
                         2: mid latitude summer
                         3: mid latitude winter
                         4: subarctic summer
                         5: subarctic winter

                  If list of integer is given, it also performs heuristics using the
                  provided values instead of default, [1, 2, 3, 4], which is used
                  when 'auto' is provided. List input should not contain 'auto'.

                  Default: 'auto'
    dtem_dh       Temperature gradient [K/km], e.g. -5.6. ("" = Tool default)

                  The value is directly passed to initialization method for ATM model.
                  Float and string types are acceptable. Float value is interpreted as
                  the value in K/km. String value should be the numeric value with unit
                  such as '-5.6K/km'. When list of values are given, it will
                  trigger heuristics to choose best model from the provided value.

                  Default: '' (tool default, -5.6K/km, is used)
    h0            Scale height for water [km], e.g. 2.0. ("" = Tool default)

                  The value is directly passed to initialization method for ATM model.
                  Float and string types are acceptable. Float value is interpreted as
                  the value in kilometer. String value should be the numeric value with
                  unit compatible with length, such as '2km' or '2000m'.
                  When list of values are given, it will trigger heuristics to
                  choose best model from the provided value.

                  Default: '' (tool default, 2.0km, is used)
    infiles       ASDM or MS files to be processed. This parameter behaves
                  as data selection parameter. The name specified by
                  infiles must be registered to context before you run
                  hsd_atmcor.
    antenna       Data selection by antenna names or ids.
                  example: 'PM03,PM04'
                           '' (all antennas)
    field         Data selection by field names or ids.
                  example: '`*Sgr*,M100`'
                           '' (all fields)
    spw           Data selection by spw ids.
                  example: '3,4' (spw 3 and 4)
                           '' (all spws)
    pol           Data selection by polarizations.
                  example: 'XX,YY' (correlation XX and YY)
                           '' (all polarizations)
    dryrun        Run the commands (True) or generate the commands to be
                  run but do not execute (False).
    acceptresults Add the results of the task to the pipeline context (True)
                  or reject them (False).

    --------- examples -----------------------------------------------------------

    1. Basic usage

    >>> hsd_atmcor()

    2. Specify atmospheric model and data selection

    >>> hsd_atmcor(atmtype=1, antenna='PM03,PM04', field='*Sgr*,M100')

    3. Specify atmospheric model per EB (atmtype 1 for 1st EB, 2 for 2nd EB)

    >>> hsd_atmcor(atmtype=[1, 2])
