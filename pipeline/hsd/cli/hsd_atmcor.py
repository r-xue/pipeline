    """Apply offline ATM correction to the data.

    The hsd_atmcor task provides the capability of offline correction of
    residual atmospheric features in the calibrated single-dish spectra
    originated from incomplete calibration mainly due to a difference of
    elevation angles between ON_SOURCE and OFF_SOURCE measurements.

    Optimal atmospheric model is automatically determined by default
    (atmtype = 'auto'). You may specify desired atmospheric model by giving
    either single integer (apply to all EBs) or a list of integers (models
    per EB) to atmtype parameter. Please see parameter description for the
    meanings of integer values.Args:
        atmtype: Type of atmospheric transmission model represented as an integer. Available options are as follows. Integer values can be given as
            either integer or string, i.e. both 1 and '1' are acceptable.
            'auto': perform heuristics to choose best model (default)
            1: tropical
            2: mid latitude summer
            3: mid latitude winter
            4: subarctic summer
            5: subarctic winter
            If list of integer is given, it also performs heuristics using the
            provided values instead of default, [1, 2, 3, 4], which is used
            when 'auto' is provided. List input should not contain 'auto'.
            Default: 'auto'

        dtem_dh: Temperature gradient [K/km], e.g. -5.6. ("" = Tool default) The value is directly passed to initialization method for ATM model.
            Float and string types are acceptable. Float value is interpreted as
            the value in K/km. String value should be the numeric value with unit
            such as '-5.6K/km'. When list of values are given, it will
            trigger heuristics to choose best model from the provided value.
            Default: '' (tool default, -5.6K/km, is used)

        h0: Scale height for water [km], e.g. 2.0. ("" = Tool default) The value is directly passed to initialization method for ATM model.
            Float and string types are acceptable. Float value is interpreted as
            the value in kilometer. String value should be the numeric value with
            unit compatible with length, such as '2km' or '2000m'.
            When list of values are given, it will trigger heuristics to
            choose best model from the provided value.
            Default: '' (tool default, 2.0km, is used)

        infiles: ASDM or MS files to be processed. This parameter behaves as data selection parameter. The name specified by
            infiles must be registered to context before you run
            hsd_atmcor.

        antenna: Data selection by antenna names or ids. example: 'PM03,PM04'
            '' (all antennas)

        field: Data selection by field names or ids. example: '`*Sgr*,M100`'
            '' (all fields)

        spw: Data selection by spw ids. example: '3,4' (spw 3 and 4)
            '' (all spws)

        pol: Data selection by polarizations. example: 'XX,YY' (correlation XX and YY)
            '' (all polarizations)

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Basic usage

        >>> hsd_atmcor()

        2. Specify atmospheric model and data selection

        >>> hsd_atmcor(atmtype=1, antenna='PM03,PM04', field='*Sgr*,M100')

        3. Specify atmospheric model per EB (atmtype 1 for 1st EB, 2 for 2nd EB)

        >>> hsd_atmcor(atmtype=[1, 2])
