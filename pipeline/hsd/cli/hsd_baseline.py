    hsd_baseline ---- Detect and validate spectral lines, subtract baseline by masking detected lines

    The hsd_baseline task subtracts baseline from calibrated spectra.
    By default, the task tries to find spectral line feature using
    line detection and validation algorithms. Then, the task puts a
    mask on detected lines and perform baseline subtraction.
    The user is able to turn off automatic line masking by setting
    linewindow parameter, which specifies pre-defined line window.

    Fitting order is automatically determined by default. It can be
    disabled by specifying fitorder as non-negative value. In this
    case, the value specified by fitorder will be used.

    ***WARNING***
    Currently, hsd_baseline overwrites the result obtained by the
    previous run. Due to this behavior, users need to be careful
    about an order of the task execution when they run hsd_baseline
    multiple times with different data selection. Suppose there are
    two spectral windows (0 and 1) and hsd_baseline is executed
    separately for each spw as below,

    >>> hsd_baseline(spw='0')
    >>> hsd_baseline(spw='1')
    >>> hsd_blflag()
    >>> hsd_imaging()

    Since the second run of hsd_baseline overwrites the result for
    spw 0 with the data before baseline subtraction, this will not
    produce correct result for spw 0. Proper sequence for this use
    case is to process each spw to the imaging stage separately,
    which looks like as follows:

    >>> hsd_baseline(spw='0')
    >>> hsd_blflag(spw='0')
    >>> hsd_imaging(spw='0'))
    >>> hsd_baseline(spw='1')
    >>> hsd_blflag(spw='1')
    >>> hsd_imaging(spw='1')

    Output:
    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    fitfunc             fitting function for baseline subtraction. You can only
                        choose cubic spline ('spline' or 'cspline')

    fitorder            Fitting order for polynomial. For cubic spline, it is used
                        to determine how much the spectrum is segmented into.
                        Default (-1) is to determine the order automatically.

    switchpoly          If True, switch to 1st or 2nd order polynomial fit when
                        large mask exists at edge regardless of whatever fitfunc
                        or fitorder are specified. Condition for switching is as
                        follows:
                            if nmask > nchan/2      => 1st order polynomial
                            else if nmask > nchan/4 => 2nd order polynomial
                            else                    => use fitfunc and fitorder
                        where nmask is a number of channels for mask at edge while
                        nchan is a number of channels of entire spectral window.

    linewindow          Pre-defined line window. If this is set, specified line
                        windows are used as a line mask for baseline subtraction
                        instead to determine masks based on line detection and
                        validation stage. Several types of format are acceptable.
                        One is channel-based window,
                            [min_chan, max_chan]
                        where min_chan and max_chan should be an integer. For
                        multiple  windows, nested list is also acceptable,
                            [[min_chan0, max_chan0], [min_chan1, max_chan1], ...]
                        Another way is frequency-based window,
                            [min_freq, max_freq]
                        where min_freq and max_freq should be either a float or
                        a string. If float value is given, it is interpreted as
                        a frequency in Hz. String should be a quantity consisting
                        of "value" and "unit",
                        e.g., '100GHz'. Multiple windows are also supported.
                            [[min_freq0, max_freq0], [min_freq1, max_freq1], ...]
                        Note that the specified frequencies are assumed to be
                        the value in LSRK frame. Note also that there is a
                        limitation when multiple MSes are processed.
                        If native frequency frame of the data is not LSRK
                        (e.g. TOPO), frequencies need to be converted to that
                        frame. As a result, corresponding channel range may vary
                        between MSes. However, current implementation is not
                        able to handle such case. Frequencies are converted to
                        desired frame using representative MS (time, position,
                        direction).

                        In the above cases, specified line windows are applied
                        to all science spws. In case when line windows vary with
                        spw, line windows can be specified by a dictionary whose
                        key is spw id while value is line window.
                        For example, the following dictionary gives different
                        line windows to spws 17 and 19. Other spws, if available,
                        will have an empty line window.
                            {17: [[100, 200], [1200, 1400]], 19: ['112115MHz', '112116MHz']}
                        Furthermore, linewindow accepts MS selection string.
                        The following string gives [[100,200],[1200,1400]] for
                        spw 17 while [1000,1500] for spw 21.
                            "17:100~200;1200~1400,21:1000~1500"
                        The string also accepts frequency with units. Note,
                        however, that frequency reference frame in this case is
                        not fixed to LSRK. Instead, the frame will be taken from
                        the MS (typically TOPO for ALMA).
                        Thus, the following two frequency-based line windows
                        result different channel selections.
                            {19: ['112115MHz', '112116MHz']} # frequency frame is LSRK
                            "19:11215MHz~11216MHz" # frequency frame is taken from the data
                                                             # (TOPO for ALMA)

                        None is allowed as a value of dictionary input to indicate that
                        no line detection/validation is required even if manually specified
                        line window does not exist. When None is given as a value and if
                        ``linewindowmode`` is 'replace', line detection/validation is not performed
                        for the corresponding spw. For example, suppose the following parameters
                        are given for the data with four science spws, 17, 19, 21, and 23.
                            linewindow={17: [112.1e9, 112.2e9], 19: [113.1e9, 113.15e9], 21: None}
                            linewindowmode='replace'
                        The task will use given line window for 17 and 19 while the task performs
                        line deteciton/validation for spw 23 because no line window is set.
                        On the other hand, line detection/validation is skipped for spw 21 due to
                        the effect of None.

                        example: [100,200] (channel), [115e9, 115.1e9] (frequency in Hz)
                                 ['115GHz', '115.1GHz'], see above for more examples

    linewindowmode      Merge or replace given manual line window with line
                        detection/validation result. If 'replace' is given, line
                        detection and validation will not be performed.
                        On the other hand, when 'merge' is specified, line
                        detection/validation will be performed and manually
                        specified line windows are added to the result.

                        Note that this has no effect when linewindow for target
                        spw is an empty list. In that case, line detection/validation
                        will be performed regardless of the value of linewindowmode.
                        In case if no linewindow nor line detection/validation
                        are necessary, you should set linewindowmode to 'replace'
                        and specify None as a value of the linewindow dictionary
                        for the spw to apply. See parameter description of ``linewindow``
                        for detail.

    edge                Number of edge channels to be dropped from baseline
                        subtraction. The value must be a list with length of 2,
                        whose values specify left and right edge channels,
                        respectively.
