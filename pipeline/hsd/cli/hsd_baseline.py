    """Detect spectral line features and subtract the baseline from calibrated single-dish spectra.

    Generates baseline fitting tables and subtracts the baseline from the spectra by masking
    detected emission/absorption line regions. The WebLog shows three sections of spectral grid
    maps per source:

    1. Spectra **before** baseline subtraction (red fitted curve overlaid on each grid cell).
    2. **Averaged** spectra per grid cell (improves S/N to reveal line features).
    3. Spectra **after** baseline subtraction (red line at zero level per grid cell).

    Cyan-shaded regions indicate channels masked as emission lines. A spatially integrated
    spectrum is shown above each grid, with the magenta curve indicating atmospheric transmission
    and thick red bars marking channels excluded by the ``deviation mask'' algorithm.
    Representative spectra in each cell correspond to the valid pointing nearest the mean
    coordinates of all pointings in that grid cell.

    **Fitting order determination**: The default function is a cubic spline. The number of
    spline segments (``N_segment``) is determined via FFT analysis of the power spectrum of
    grouped spectra:

    1. ``1 < P_FFT < 3`` → ``N_segment = 4``
    2. ``3 <= P_FFT < 5`` → ``N_segment = 5``
    3. ``5 <= P_FFT < 10`` → ``N_segment = 6``
    4. ``P_FFT >= 10`` → ``N_segment = F_FFT * 2 + 2``

    The final ``N_segment`` is scaled by ``(Nch - N_mask) / Nch`` to account for masked channels.
    Specifying a non-negative integer for ``fitorder`` disables auto-determination.

    **Mask range determination**: Emission/absorption channels are identified by comparing
    spectral deviation from the median against an MAD-based threshold. Up to 10 iterations
    are performed to detect weak lines; each detected range is extended while the intensity is
    monotonically decreasing/increasing. Binned spectra (widths 1, 4, 16, 64 for 4096-channel
    spws) are also analyzed for broad features, with threshold ``3.5 + sqrt(binning_width) * MAD``.

    **Baseline flatness evaluation** (fourth section of the WebLog page): Emission-free channels
    are divided into 10 or 20 bins. ``MAX(mean) - MIN(mean)`` across bins is compared to the
    spectral rms ``sigma``.

    Notes:
        Three QA scores are computed:

        **Spectral line detection**:

        - QA = 1.0 if no edge-line and main line is narrow.
        - QA = 0.60 if no edge-line and main line is wide.
        - QA = 0.55 if edge-line detected (regardless of main line width).
        - QA = 0.80 if no spectral lines are detected.
        - QA = 0.88 if the deviation mask overlaps with spectral or atmospheric lines.

        **Baseline flatness** (MAX(mean) - MIN(mean) vs. sigma):

        - QA = 0.33 if MAX(mean) - MIN(mean) > 3.6 sigma.
        - QA = 0.33-1.0 if 1.8 sigma <= MAX(mean) - MIN(mean) < 3.6 sigma.
        - QA = 1.0 if MAX(mean) - MIN(mean) < 1.8 sigma.

        **Deviation from zero-baseline**: QA = 0.65 if significant deviation outside candidate
        line ranges is detected (triggering deviation masks).

    Warning:
        ``hsd_baseline`` overwrites results from previous runs. If processing spws separately,
        each spw must be taken through to the imaging stage before the next spw is processed::

            hsd_baseline(spw='0'); hsd_blflag(spw='0'); hsd_imaging(spw='0')
            hsd_baseline(spw='1'); hsd_blflag(spw='1'); hsd_imaging(spw='1')

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Basic usage with automatic line detection:

        >>> hsd_baseline(antenna='PM03', spw='17,19')

        2. Use pre-defined line windows instead of automatic detection:

        >>> hsd_baseline(linewindow=[[100, 200], [1200, 1400]], linewindowmode='replace', edge=[10, 10])

        3. Per-spw pre-defined line windows merged with automatic detection:

        >>> hsd_baseline(linewindow={19: [[390, 550]], 23: [[100, 200], [1200, 1400]]},
        ...             linewindowmode='merge')
