def round_half_up(value: int | str, precision: float = 0) -> float:
    """
    Provides the "round to given precision with ties going away from zero"
    behaviour that was the default Python2 rounding behavior.

    The behaviour of the "round" built-in changed from Python 2 to Python 3.

    In Python 2, round() was rounding to the given precision, with ties going
    away from 0. For example:

    [round(a) for a in [-2.5, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]] == [-3.0, -2.0, -1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

    In Python 3, round() become "Banker's rounding", rounding to the nearest
    even integer, following the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic.
    For example:

    >>> [round(a) for a in [-2.5, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]]
    [-2, -2, 0, 0, 2, 2]

    Note: in this function and the underlying Python decimal module,
    "round half up" refers to "round half away from zero" behaviour, rather than
    rounding half up to positive infinity.

    Args:
        value: Un-rounded value
        precision: Precision of un-rounded value to consider when rounding

    Returns:
        rounded value to given precision with ties going away from 0
