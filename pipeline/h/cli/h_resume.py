    h_resume restores a name pipeline state from disk, allowing a
    suspended pipeline reduction session to be resumed.

    Args:
        filename: Name of the saved pipeline state. Setting filename to 'last' restores the most recently saved pipeline state whose name
            begins with 'context*'.

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Resume the last saved session

        >>> h_resume()

        2. Resume the named saved session

        >>> h_resume(filename='context.s3.2012-02-13T10:49:11')
