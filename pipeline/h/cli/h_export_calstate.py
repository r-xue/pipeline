    h_export_calstate ---- Save the pipeline calibration state to disk

    
    h_export_calstate saves the current pipeline calibration state to disk
    in the form of a set of equivalent applycal calls.
    
    If filename is not given, h_export_calstate saves the calibration state to
    disk with a filename based on the pipeline context creation time, using the
    extension '.calstate'
    
    One of two calibration states can be exported: either the active calibration
    state (those calibrations currently applied on-the-fly but scheduled for
    permanent application to the MeasurementSet in a subsequent hif_applycal
    call) or the applied calibration state (calibrations that were previously
    applied to the MeasurementSet using hif_applycal). The default is to export
    the active calibration state.

    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    filename Name for saved calibration state
    state    The calibration state to export

    --------- examples -----------------------------------------------------------

    
    
    1. Save the calibration state.
    
    >>> h_export_calstate()
    
    2. Save the active calibration state with a custom filename
    
    >>> h_export_calstate(filename='afterbandpass.calstate')
    
    3. Save the applied calibration state with a custom filename
    
    >>> h_export_calstate(filename='applied.calstate', state='applied')

    --------- issues -----------------------------------------------------------
        
    If run several times in one pipeline session does the automatic export
    file naming scheme, overwrite previous versions?
