    Generate default spectral window map for ALMA Tsys, including TDM->FDM
    associations.

    This function generates an "applycal-ready" SpW-to-Tsys-SpW mapping that
    provides the appropriate information regarding the transfer of the Tsys
    calibration from TDM spectral windows to FDM spectral windows.

    If provided a Tsys Caltable that you wish to apply to a MeasurementSet, then
    it filters to only use Tsys SpW(s) that appear in the caltable; otherwise,
    it will use all Tsys SpWs present in MS and assume these are present in the
    caltable.

    The resulting tsys spwmap can then be supplied to the applycal spwmap
    parameter to ensure proper Tsys calibration application.

    Args:
        ms: The measurement set (object) to process.
        tsystable: Optional, the input Tsys caltable (w/ TDM Tsys measurements),
            used to identify which Tsys SpW(s) are available.
        channel_tolerance: Frequency tolerance in number of channels to use in
            matching Tsys SpW freq. range to SpW freq. range.
        trim: If True (the default), return minimum-length spwmap; otherwise the
            spwmap will be exhaustive and include the high-numbered (and usually
            irrelevant) WVR SpWs.

    Returns:
        2-tuple containing:
        - list of unmatched SpW IDs.
        - list representing the SpW-to-Tsys-SpW mapping.
