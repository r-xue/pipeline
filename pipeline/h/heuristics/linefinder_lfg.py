        Invoke line finding algorithm and return indices of spectral line ranges.

        Line finding is based on zero-crossing of 1st/2nd derivatives of input

            spectrum: list of spectrum data.
            mask: mask of spectrum array. An elements of spectrum is valid when
                  the corresponding element of mask is True. If False, invalid.
                  The length of list should be equal to that of spectrum.
