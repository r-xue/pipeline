# Prototype script for SD applycal QA score (PIPEREQ-176)
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# run_sd_applycal_qa.py: Main script used to test main QA score algorithm in sd_applycal_qa.py.
#                        Reads in a pipeline execution folder, searches for all calibrated MSs,
#                        runs the heuristics and produces reports used for heuristic testing.
# sd_applycal_qa.py:     Main module containing the applycal QA heuristics.
# sd_qa_reports.py:      Auxiliary module containing the reporting and plotting routines used.
# sd_qa_utils.py:        Auxiliary module containing general utilities used to access data and
#                        perform some general statistical calculations.
# mswrapper_sd.py:       Module containing the MSWrapperSD class, a data container for accessing
# 		       the necessary ON-source data and CalAtmosphere tables.
# pipelineqa.py:         Copy of the pipeline file containing the TargetDataSelection and
#                        QAScore classes.
#
# Usage:
#
# run_sd_applycal_qa.py [-o /output_path] 2021.1.00490.S_2024_04_03T17_03_51.553
#
# If the optional output path is not given, the output is put into the working folder of the pipeline
# execution. in this case, e.g.
#
# 2021.1.00490.S_2024_04_03T17_03_51.553/SOUS_uid___A001_X1590_X222a/GOUS_uid___A001_X1590_X222b/MOUS_uid___A001_X1590_X222e/working/sd_applycal_output
#
# where the main reports and plots will be saved. Additionally, a very short output will be put in the
# base of the working folder for testing and QA0++ uses.
