    hifv_mstransform ---- Create new MeasurementSets for science target imaging


    Create new MeasurementSets for imaging from the corrected column of the input
    MeasurementSet via a single call to mstransform with all data selection parameters.
    By default, all science target data is copied to the new MS. The
    new MeasurementSet is not re-indexed to the selected data and the new MS will
    have the same source, field, and spw names and ids as it does in the parent MS.

    Output

    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    vis                 The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
                        MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
                        '': use all MeasurementSets in the context

                        Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    outputvis           The list of output transformed MeasurementSets to be used for
                        continuum imaging. The output list must be the same length as the input
                        list. The default output name defaults to
                        <msrootname>_targets_cont.ms

                        Examples: 'ngc5921.ms',
                            ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    outputvis_for_line  The list of output transformed MeasurementSets to be used for
                        line imaging. The output list must be the same length as the input
                        list. The default output name defaults to
                        <msrootname>_targets.ms

                        Examples: 'ngc5921.ms',
                                    ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']
    field               Select fields name(s) or id(s) to transform. Only fields with
                        data matching the intent will be selected.

                        Examples: '3C279', 'Centaurus*', '3C279,J1427-421'
    intent              Select intents for which associated fields will be imaged.
                        By default only TARGET data is selected.

                        Examples: 'PHASE,BANDPASS'
    spw                 Select spectral window/channels to include for continuum imaging. By default all
                        science spws for which the specified intent is valid are
                        selected.
    spw_line            Select spectral window/channels to include for line imaging.
                        If specified, these will override the default, which
                        is to use the spws identified as specline_windows in hifv_importdata
                        or hifv_restoredata.
    chanbin             Width (bin) of input channels to average to form an output
                        channel. If chanbin > 1 then chanaverage is automatically
                        switched to True.
    timebin             Bin width for time averaging. If timebin > 0s then
                        timeaverage is automatically switched to True.

    omit_line_ms        If True, don't make the line ms (_targets.ms)
                        
    --------- examples -----------------------------------------------------------


    1. Create a science target MS from the corrected column in the input MS.

    >>> hifv_mstransform()

    2. Make a phase and bandpass calibrator targets MS from the corrected
    column in the input MS.

    >>> hifv_mstransform(intent='PHASE,BANDPASS')
