    """Apply calibration tables to measurement set

    hifv_applycals applies the precomputed calibration tables stored in the pipeline
    context to the set of visibility files using predetermined field and
    spectral window maps and default values for the interpolation schemes.

    Users can interact with the pipeline calibration state using the tasks
    h_export_calstate and h_import_calstate.

    Parameters:
        vis: The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hifv_importdata task.

        field: A string containing the list of field names or field ids to which the calibration will be applied. Defaults to all fields in the pipeline
            context.
            example: '3C279', '3C279, M82'

        intent: A string containing the list of intents against which the selected fields will be matched. Defaults to all supported intents
            in the pipeline context.
            example: `'*TARGET*'`

        spw: The list of spectral windows and channels to which the calibration will be applied. Defaults to all science windows in the pipeline.
            example: '17', '11, 15'

        antenna: The selection of antennas to which the calibration will be applied. Defaults to all antennas. Not currently supported.

        applymode: Calibration apply mode 'calflag': calibrate data and apply flags from solutions
            'calflagstrict': same as above except flag spws for which calibration is
            unavailable in one or more tables (instead of allowing them to pass
            uncalibrated and unflagged)
            'trial': report on flags from solutions, dataset entirely unchanged
            'flagonly': apply flags from solutions only, data not calibrated
            'flagonlystrict': same as above except flag spws for which calibration is
            unavailable in one or more tables
            'calonly': calibrate data only, flags from solutions NOT applied

        flagbackup: Backup the flags before the apply.

        flagsum: Compute before and after flagging summary statistics

        flagdetailedsum: Compute detailed flagging statistics

        gainmap: Mode to map gainfields to scans.

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Run the final applycals stage of the VLA CASA pipeline.
