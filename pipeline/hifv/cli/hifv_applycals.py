    hifv_applycals ---- Apply calibration tables to measurement set

    hifv_applycals applies the precomputed calibration tables stored in the pipeline
    context to the set of visibility files using predetermined field and
    spectral window maps and default values for the interpolation schemes.
    
    Users can interact with the pipeline calibration state using the tasks
    h_export_calstate and h_import_calstate.

    Output:
    
    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returne
    
    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    vis             The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets
                    specified in the h_init or hifv_importdata task.     
    field           A string containing the list of field names or field ids to which
                    the calibration will be applied. Defaults to all fields in the pipeline
                    context.
                    example: '3C279', '3C279, M82'
    intent          A string containing the list of intents against which the
                    selected fields will be matched. Defaults to all supported intents
                    in the pipeline context.
                    example: `'*TARGET*'`
    spw             The list of spectral windows and channels to which the calibration
                    will be applied. Defaults to all science windows in the pipeline.
                    example: '17', '11, 15'
    antenna         The selection of antennas to which the calibration will be applied.
                    Defaults to all antennas. Not currently supported.
    applymode       Calibration apply mode
                    'calflag': calibrate data and apply flags from solutions
                    'calflagstrict': same as above except flag spws for which calibration is
                        unavailable in one or more tables (instead of allowing them to pass
                        uncalibrated and unflagged)
                    'trial': report on flags from solutions, dataset entirely unchanged
                    'flagonly': apply flags from solutions only, data not calibrated
                    'flagonlystrict': same as above except flag spws for which calibration is
                        unavailable in one or more tables
                    'calonly': calibrate data only, flags from solutions NOT applied
    flagbackup      Backup the flags before the apply.
    flagsum         Compute before and after flagging summary statistics
    flagdetailedsum Compute detailed flagging statistics
    gainmap         Mode to map gainfields to scans.
    dryrun          Run the commands (True) or generate the commands to be run but
                    do not execute (False).  This is a pipeline task execution mode.
    acceptresults   Add the results of the task to the pipeline context (True) or
                    reject them (False).  This is a pipeline task execution mode.

    --------- examples -----------------------------------------------------------
    
    
    1. Run the final applycals stage of the VLA CASA pipeline.
    
    >>> hifv_applycals()

    --------- issues -----------------------------------------------------------

    There is some discussion about the appropriate values of calwt. Given
    properly scaled data, the correct value should be the CASA default of True.
    However at the current time ALMA is suggesting that calwt be set to True for
    applying observatory calibrations, e.g. antenna positions, WVR, and system
    temperature corrections, and to False for applying instrument calibrations,
    e.g. bandpass, gain, and flux.
