<example>

hif_export_calstate saves the current pipeline calibration state to disk
in the form of a set of equivalent applycal calls.

Keyword arguments:

filename -- Name for the saved calibration state.


Description

hif_export_calstate saves the current pipeline calibration state to disk
in the form of a set of equivalent applycal calls.

If filename is not given, hif_export_calstate saves the calibration state to
disk with a filename based on the pipeline context creation time, using the
extension '.calstate'

Issues

If run several times in one pipeline session does the automatic export
file naming scheme, overwrite previous versions?

Example

1. Save the calibration state.

   hif_export_calstate()

2. Save the calibration state in a user supplied file.

   hif_export_calstate(filename='afterbandpass.calstate')
