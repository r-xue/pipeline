    """Create new MeasurementSets for science target imaging

    Create new MeasurementSets for imaging from the corrected column of the input
    MeasurementSet via a single call to mstransform with all data selection parameters.
    By default, all science target data is copied to the new MS. The
    new MeasurementSet is not re-indexed to the selected data and the new MS will
    have the same source, field, and spw names and ids as it does in the parent MS.

    Output

    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.Parameters:
        vis: The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
            '': use all MeasurementSets in the context
            Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']

        outputvis: The list of output transformed MeasurementSets to be used for imaging. The output list must be the same length as the input
            list. The default output name defaults to
            <msrootname>_targets.ms
            Examples: 'ngc5921.ms',
            ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']

        field: Select fields name(s) or id(s) to transform. Only fields with data matching the intent will be selected.
            Examples: '3C279', 'Centaurus*', '3C279,J1427-421'

        intent: Select intents for which associated fields will be imaged. By default only TARGET data is selected.
            Examples: 'PHASE,BANDPASS'

        spw: Select spectral window/channels to image. By default all science spws for which the specified intent is valid are
            selected.

        chanbin: Width (bin) of input channels to average to form an output channel. If chanbin > 1 then chanaverage is automatically
            switched to True.

        timebin: Bin width for time averaging. If timebin > 0s then timeaverage is automatically switched to True.

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Create a science target MS from the corrected column in the input MS.

        >>> hif_mstransform()

        2. Make a phase and bandpass calibrator targets MS from the corrected
        column in the input MS.

        >>> hif_mstransform(intent='PHASE,BANDPASS')
