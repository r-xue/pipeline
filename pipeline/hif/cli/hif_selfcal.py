    --------- parameter descriptions ---------------------------------------------

    vis                     The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
                            MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
                            default = "": use all MeasurementSets in the context
    field                   Select fields to image. Use field name(s) NOT id(s). Mosaics
                            are assumed to have common source / field names.  If intent is
                            specified only fields with data matching the intent will be
                            selected. The fields will be selected from MeasurementSets in
                            "vis".
                            default= "" Fields matching intent, one image per target source.

    apply                   Apply final selfcal solutions back to the input MeasurementSets.
                            default = True
    recal                   Always re-do self-calibration even solutions/caltables are found in the Pipeline 
                            context or json restore file.
                            default = False
    refantignore            string list to be ignored as reference antennas.
                            example:  refantignore='ea02,ea03'
    restore_resources       Path to the restore resources from a standard run of hif_selfcal.
                            hif_selfcal will automatically do an exhaustive search to lookup/extract/verify 
                            the selfcal restore resources, i.e., selfcal.json and all selfcal-caltable referred 
                            in selfcal.json, starting from working/, to products/ and rawdata/.
                            If restore_resources is specified, this file path will be evaluated first
                            before the pre-defined exhaustive search list.
                            The value can be the file path of *auxproducts.tgz file or *selfcal.json file.
    n_solints               number of solution intervals to attempt for self-calibration.
                            default: 4                            
    amplitude_selfcal       Attempt amplitude self-calibration following phase-only self-calibration; 
                            if median time between scans of a given target is < 150s, 
                            solution intervals of 300s and inf will be attempted, otherwise just 
                            inf will be attempted.
                            default = False

                            of a source.
                            default = 3.0
    delta_beam_thresh       Allowed fractional change in beam size for selfcalibration to accept 
                            results of a solution interval.
                            default = 0.05
    apply_cal_mode_default  Apply mode to use for applycal task 
                            during self-calibration; same options as applycal.
                            default = 'calflag'
    rel_thresh_scaling      Scaling type to determine how clean thresholds 
                            per solution interval should be determined going from the starting 
                            clean threshold to 3.0 * RMS for the final solution interval.
                            default='log10', options: 'linear', 'log10', or 'loge' (natural log)
    dividing_factor         Scaling factor 
                            to determine clean threshold for first self-calibration solution interval.
                            Equivalent to (Peak S/N / dividing_factor) *RMS = First clean threshold;
                            however, if (Peak S/N / dividing_factor) *RMS is < 5.0; a value of 5.0 
                            is used for the first clean threshold.
                            default = 40 for < 8 GHz; 15 for > 8 GHz
    check_all_spws          If True, the S/N of mfs images created on a per-spectral-window basis will 
                            be compared at the initial stages final self-calibration.
                            default=False
    inf_EB_gaincal_combine  change gain solution combination parameters for the inf_EB solution interval. 
                            if True, the gaincal combine parameter will be set to 'scan,spw'; if False,
                            the gaincal combine parameter will be set to 'scan'.
                            default=False              
    --------- examples -----------------------------------------------------------    

    1. Run self-calibration and apply solutions to all science targets and spws
    
    >>> hif_selfcal()

    2. Run self-calibration and apply solutions to a single science target

    >>> hif_selfcal(field="3C279")

    3. Run self-calibration with a more relaxed allowed fractional change in the beam size for a solution interval to be successful

    >>> hif_selfcal(delta_beam_thresh=0.15)
