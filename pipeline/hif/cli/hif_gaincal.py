    """Determine temporal gains from calibrator observations

    The complex gains are derived from the data column (raw data) divided by the
    model column (usually set with hif_setjy). The gains are obtained for a
    specified solution interval, spw combination and field combination.

    Good candidate reference antennas can be determined using the hif_refant
    task.

    Previous calibrations that have been stored in the pipeline context are
    applied on the fly. Users can interact with these calibrations via the
    h_export_calstate and h_import_calstate tasks.

    Output

    results -- The results object for the pipeline task is returned.Parameters:
        vis: The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets specified in the h_init or hif_importdata task.
            '': use all MeasurementSets in the context
            Examples: 'ngc5921.ms', ['ngc5921a.ms', ngc5921b.ms', 'ngc5921c.ms']

        caltable: The list of output calibration tables. Defaults to the standard pipeline naming convention.
            Example: caltable=['M82.gcal', 'M82B.gcal']

        field: The list of field names or field ids for which gain solutions are to be computed. Defaults to all fields with the standard
            intent.
            Example: field='3C279', field='3C279, M82'

        intent: A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against which the selected fields are matched. Defaults to `*PHASE*`.
            Examples: intent='', intent='`*AMP*,*PHASE*`'

        spw: The list of spectral windows and channels for which gain solutions are computed. Defaults to all science spectral
            windows.
            Examples: spw='21', spw='21, 23'

        antenna: Set of data selection antenna ids

        hm_gaintype: The type of gain calibration. The options are 'gtype' and 'gspline' for CASA gain types = 'G' and 'GSPLINE' respectively.

        calmode: Type of solution. The options are 'ap' (amp and phase), 'p' (phase only) and 'a' (amp only).
            Examples: calmode='p', calmode='a', calmode='ap'

        solint: Time solution intervals in CASA syntax. Works for hm_gaintype='gtype' only.
            Examples: solint='inf', solint='int', solint='100sec'

        combine: Data axes to combine for solving. Options are  '', 'scan', 'spw', 'field' or any comma-separated combination. Works for
            hm_gaintype='gtype' only.

        refant: Reference antenna name(s) in priority order. Defaults to most recent values set in the pipeline context. If no reference
            antenna is defined in the pipeline context use the CASA
            defaults.
            Examples: refant='DV01', refant='DV05,DV07'

        refantmode: Controls how the refant is applied. Currently available choices are 'flex', 'strict', and the default value of ''.
            Setting to '' allows the pipeline to select the appropriate
            mode based on the state of the reference antenna list.
            Examples: refantmode='strict', refantmode=''

        solnorm: Normalize average solution amplitudes to 1.0

        minblperant: Minimum number of baselines required per antenna for each solve. Antennas with fewer baselines are excluded from
            solutions. Works for hm_gaintype='gtype' only.

        minsnr: Solutions below this SNR are rejected. Works for hm_gaintype='channel' only.

        smodel: Point source Stokes parameters for source model (experimental). Defaults to using standard MODEL_DATA column data.
            Example: smodel=[1,0,0,0]  - (I=1, unpolarized)

        splinetime: Spline timescale (sec). Used for hm_gaintype='gspline'. Typical splinetime should cover about 3 to 5 calibrator scans.

        npointaver: Tune phase-unwrapping algorithm. Used for hm_gaintype='gspline'. Keep at default value.

        phasewrap: Wrap the phase for changes larger than this amount (degrees). Used for hm_gaintype='gspline'. Keep at default value.

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        Compute standard per scan gain solutions that will be used to calibrate
        the target:

        >>> hif_gaincal()
