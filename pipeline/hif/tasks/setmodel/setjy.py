        Args:
            context: Pipeline context.

            output_dir: Output directory.
                Defaults to None, which corresponds to the current working directory.

            vis: The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of MeasurementSets defined in the pipeline context.

            field: The list of field names or field ids for which the models are to be set. Defaults to all fields with intent '`*AMPLITUDE*`'.

                Example: field='3C279', field='3C279, M82'

            intent: A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against which the selected fields are matched. Defaults to all data
                with amplitude intent.

                Example: intent='`*AMPLITUDE*`'

            spw: The list of spectral windows and channels for which bandpasses are computed. Defaults to all science spectral windows.

                Example: spw='11,13,15,17'

            model: Model image for setting model visibilities. Not fully supported.

                Example: see details in help for CASA setjy task

            scalebychan: This determines whether the fluxdensity set in the model is calculated on a per channel basis. If False then only one fluxdensity
                value is calculated per spw.

            fluxdensity: Specified flux density [I,Q,U,V] in Jy. Uses [1,0,0,0] flux density for unrecognized sources, and standard flux densities for
                ones recognized by 'standard', including 3C286, 3C48, 3C147, and several
                planets, moons, and asteroids.

                Example: [3.06,0.0,0.0,0.0]

            spix: Spectral index for fluxdensity S = fluxdensity * (freq/reffreq)**spix Only used if fluxdensity is being used. If fluxdensity is positive, and
                spix is nonzero, then reffreq must be set too. It is applied in the same
                way to all polarizations, and does not account for Faraday rotation or
                depolarization.

            reffreq: The reference frequency for spix, given with units. Provided to avoid division by zero. If the flux density is being scaled by spectral
                index, then reffreq must be set to whatever reference frequency is correct
                for the given fluxdensity and spix. It cannot be determined from vis. On
                the other hand, if spix is 0, then any positive frequency can be used and
                will be ignored.

                Example: reffreq='86.0GHz', reffreq='4.65e9Hz'

            standard: Flux density standard, used if fluxdensity[0] less than 0.0. The options are: 'Baars','Perley 90','Perley-Taylor 95', 'Perley-Taylor 99',
                'Perley-Butler 2010' and 'Butler-JPL-Horizons 2010'.
                default: 'Butler-JPL-Horizons 2012' for solar system object
                'Perley-Butler 2010' otherwise

            refspectra:

            reffile: Path to a file containing flux densities for calibrators unknown to CASA. Values given in this file take precedence over the CASA-derived
                values for all calibrators except solar system calibrators. By default the
                path is set to the CSV file created by h_importdata, consisting of
                catalogue fluxes extracted from the ASDM.
                example: reffile='', reffile='working/flux.csv'

            normfluxes: Normalize lookup fluxes.
